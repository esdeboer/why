If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.\n\nThis event is based on '''donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds'''.\n\nSo lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!\n\nTo add your own cheese, add it to the wiki below\n\n[https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/FHB@WHY2025/Cheese_Rendezvous Click here for a list of cheeses]",

    "description": "Age range: 16+\nWe all speak high about privacy and safety of internet use. The EU also has extensive legislation to protect people, businesses, and copyright holders.  However, in my experience, projects have very successful ways to make it difficult to execute your rights.  To name a few tricks: it's hard to find the source data collection, there are many data collections, you are required to deliver a difficult proof you have legal rights, and all processes are different.\n\nHere, I generalize various kinds of \"execute my right\" processes under the name \"take-down requests\".  It could be the wish to take down a physical server, all virtual servers of a certain company, a webpage with proclaimed defamation or other illegal content.\n\nThe very good reason to make submission of take-down requests hard, is that handling them is a labor intensive ad-hoc process. Some requests are clear, but sometimes many different laws and local society feelings have to be considered.  Very certainly, different data maintainers will decide different about the same request.\n\nThe Lethe project tries to simplify the submission of take-down requests to many data collectors at the same time.  It defines a clear template and collects various proofs about the claim by the submitter.  Then, it does not only distribute the request, but also shares the effort that participating data maintainers put in handling the claim.  For instance, NCSC-NL might report: \"server shutdown\", so the search engine index maintainer does not have to handle the request anymore, simply remove the pages from the index.\n\nWe will present the first steps towards this standardization, looking for contributors and funding.  Hopefully, this workshop starts a healthy debate.",

This workshop is a hands-on experience that reviews the basics of Korean kimchi making and today's preparation styles. We will go through the main topics which are salt to vegetables and liquid ratio and when to apply it and how. This one is crucial. We will explain the importance of the effect of ginger, garlic and spicy pepper and their roles in preventing unwanted microbial development.

Day 4, 18h30, to secure spot on this guided tasting workshop please sign in here.]\n\n\nThis event is dedicated to cider, cidre, sidra or how ever you would like to call beverage prepared by fermentation of apple juice. This event is run by Franti\u0161ek [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvas\u00edrna Jara] project which is a commercial one. \n\n'''Aims&Selection'''\nThe aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on \"typical\" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more \"complex\" \"natural ciders\" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poir\u00e9s (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poir\u00e9 which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.\n\n'''Style'''\nThis tasting workshop is based on \"donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds\" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid \"commercialization\" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace.\n\nThis tasting event is based on \"donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds\".

But hey, you've made something custom and unique! ;-)\n* Be very careful with the transfer press - it gets '''HOT!''' (130-160\u00b0C). Kids cannot use the press without supervision!\n* Only press cotton, polyester/cotton blends or nylon items! Other fabrics generally don't play nice with the heat and could melt or won't work with the vinyl I'm bringing. When in doubt, ask me to check the fabric label first so we can adjust the temperature accordingly.\n\n=== Practical info ===\n* I'll be around most of the time, but if you don't see me, ask around Pancake village for '''Distels''' or poke me on IRC\n* I'll bring small bags (for dice, card decks, or small knick-knacks) and fabric that you can decorate and, if you like, hand-sew into something. Or you can bring your own items to decorate. \n* As long the items are 100% cotton, a polyester/cotton blend, polyester or nylon, it'll work with the vinyl I'm bringing.\n* You can bring your own design files in SVG, PNG or JPG format, GIMP works fine for this, and we can try to convert those to .fcm with varying success. \n* Simple designs in SVG or PNG with thick lines and black/white work best. Unfortunately .FCM is Brother proprietary and my plotter works only with these files\n* Please please please... don't hack (or break) my setup. I will probably keep everything offline but USB sticks can do damage too ;-)\n* Your design needs to be mirrored, especially if you're using text. Unless you like it backwards ;-)\n* I will '''try''' to provide a laptop or pc on which to convert designs from .PNG/.SVG to .FCM or to make small adjustments before cutting\n\n=== Other stuff I'm probably bringing ===\n* Assorted yarn, crochet/knitting needles and other fiberart related stuff\n* Random craft supplies (paper, glue, scissors, colored pencils, etc.)\n* Hand-sewing supplies \n\n=== Tips if you want to decorate a shirt  ===\n* I'm not bringing any blanco shirts since I cannot predict your size and don't have a stock, but you can get some at the local shops: Zeeman, Action and HEMA have, not too expensive, T-shirts and aren't too far from our campsite (check [[Facilities]]). \n\nJoin me for some relaxing old-school arts and crafts. You are welcome!",

Niki (12) and Vika (11) meet in the underground subway tunnels where their families hide from Russian bombs. \u2018A positive attitude can help you forget everything.\u2019\n\nOn a cold February morning, 12-year-old Niki and his family arrive at the Kharkiv metro station to take shelter from the terrifying war raging outside. For Niki\u2019s family, daylight is synonymous with mortal danger, and the boy is not allowed to leave the station premises, living under the constant glow of their neon lights. While aimlessly wandering around the abandoned cars and full platforms, Niki meets Vika (11), and a new world opens up to him. As their bond strengthens, the children find the courage once again to feel the sun on their faces.\n\nSlovakian filmmaker duo Ivan Ostrochovsk\u00fd and Pavol Pekar\u010d\u00edk choose the path of hope rather than despondency to depict the tragedy of war: a nice man sings lyrics about love, while two children look towards the sky and their future.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiDu6oPtGI",

We will provide the materials so you can create your own album cover art, for your own imaginary (techno-critical?) band! :)",

We will explain basic concepts of probiotic, prebiotic and biofilm based polycultures and why it is good to consume foods \u201clabeled\u201d by these terms. You will prepare your own kefir culture, based on the  [https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Recipe:Kefir_making_manual_-_short_workshop_form working manual] and take it with you so you will be ready to brew wherever you decide hopefully \u201cpositively infecting\u201d your local hackerspace.

The main aim of this workshop is for the participants to understand the principles behind the milk fermentation with kefir culture and not to be afraid to just do it. Combined with the practical experience which I provide you will be able to take care properly about your kefir culture which is the key for your successful long term fermentation adventures! Don't worry too much about loosing a batch or two, that happens from time to time, keeping the \"mother culture\" happy is the important part. As usually there will be tasters, cultures sharing, manuals and various hints how to use the products in alternative ways making for example probiotic drinks from whey, kefir cheese spreads, kefir cake et cetera.

    "description": "Age range: All ages\nIn this demonstration we are going to show how to find the signals of a NAND flash chip (i.e. CLE, ALE, RE, WE, CE etc). This can be used in for example a broken SD-card. An SD-Card has a controller and an internal connection to a NAND Flash chip. If the controller is broken it might be possible to access the NAND flash to get to the raw data. But in some cases the connections are unknown. This method demonstrates how to find these NAND flash signals by using an FPGA and do an exhaustive search by sending commands to the chip in all possible combinations until a response is received from the chip.",

During four months at the front, she wrote letters to her son Theo and recorded her experiences in a cinematic diary. \n\nIn My Dear Th\u00e9o, Kovalenko, known for the documentaries Home Games and We Will Not Fade Away, which were screened at film festivals worldwide, swaps her role as a filmmaker for that of a soldier. In poetic, deeply moving letters to her son, she reflects on the harsh realities of war and her search for humanity amid violence and loss. The letters, which were later recorded, form a rare and powerful contrast to the raw images of the war zone: they capture both existential angst and the unbreakable bond between a mother and her child. \n\nWith her intimate and confrontational images, Kovalenko blurs the line between personal and collective history. My Dear Th\u00e9o is not only a record of struggle and survival, but also a timeless testament to love, hope and human resilience.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fes329l6d6U",

Day 4, 18h30, to secure spot on this guided tasting workshop please sign in here.]\n\n\nThis event is dedicated to cider, cidre, sidra or how ever you would like to call beverage prepared by fermentation of apple juice. This event is run by Franti\u0161ek [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvas\u00edrna Jara] project which is a commercial one. \n\n'''Aims&Selection'''\nThe aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on \"typical\" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more \"complex\" \"natural ciders\" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poir\u00e9s (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poir\u00e9 which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.\n\n'''Style'''\nThis tasting workshop is based on \"donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds\" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid \"commercialization\" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace.\n\nThis tasting event is based on \"donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds\". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.\n\nFor a list of ciders go to [[https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/FHB@WHY2025/cider_flows|the food hacking base page of this session]]",

    "description": "Age range: All ages\n== Workshop Description == \nThe Pathlighter PCB, initially known as the Glow Club PCB, is a wearable piece of PCB art crafted for the community.\nIt serves a dual purpose: as a practical tool for teaching about LEDs and soldering, and as a creative demonstration of using a PCB\u2019s foundational layers to craft a unique art piece. Designed to be worn on a lanyard, the Pathlighter PCB acts as a beacon, lighting up the night and ensuring safety for its wearers.  \n  \nThis innovative PCB made its debut in an electronics education group and has since been featured in soldering workshops at ToorCamp 2022 and Chaos Communication Camp \u201923. Its design is particularly well-suited for larger events where workshop demand often outstrips available resources. The Pathlighter PCB\u2019s efficient design allows newcomers to complete their project in approximately 20 minutes. This swift completion rate creates a \u201crevolving door\u201d dynamic in the workshop, allowing for a continuous flow of participants and maximizing educational outreach.  \n  \nHaving been taught to over 450 students so far, the Pathlighter PCB workshop has been a delightful experience to teach students how to solder and to earn a unique wearable art piece. Each participant not only learns valuable skills but also becomes an honorary member of the Glow Club. May we all shine brighter together through these shared experiences.  \n  \nWorkshop given by DRC  \n\nMaterials cost: \u20ac10 - \u20ac15\n<br>\n<br>\n[[File:HHA_WHY_logo.png|center|300px]]  \n  \n== Complete Hardware Hacking Area Village Schedule == \nWorkshops are all free to attend.<br>\nThe prices in the yellow boxes are the materials costs for participating in the hands-on part of the workshop.<br><br>\n[[File:WHY_HHA_schedule.png|720px]]\n\n== Location of Hardware Hacking Area Village == \n[[File:HHA_map_WHY.jpg|720px]]",

Create your design before you come to the session.\n\nEither create a digital design of your choice or draw it on paper with the media of your choice, be aware the badges and bottle openers are round and ideally need a blead-over area around the edge, so include some extra design that will go around the egdes of the badge.  If you're making a paper design, be aware the badge core is 58mm diameter so make sure it will fit!  If you have a digital design you can also make smaller badges as we can scale them.\n\nBadges are free, the bottle openers are \u20ac3 to cover the cost.",
