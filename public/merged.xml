                <description>We would love to share the story about the only podcast about a hackercamp in the UNIVERSE!
 We've made a s**tload of mistakes, learned a lot and would love to share:
1. The origin story. 3 people and a google doc. 
2. What we did to make it happen in the technical sense, but also putting a spotlight on all the AMAZING volunteers pulling this camp off
3. AI use to make the podcast more accessible
4. Lessons learned; what did we learn in creating 42 podcasts in 42 weeks?</description>

                <abstract>Did you know that if you change a single bit from 1 to 0 (or vice versa) in the first 'g' of the domain name google.com (which is 01100111 in binary) you will end up with variety of valid "bitflip" domains like coogle.com, oogle.com, &amp; woogle.com

So what happens if you generate and register a bunch of cheap bitfliped versions of popular cloud / Saas provider domains, point them to your VPS, log all incoming requests &amp; then forget about the whole thing for two years?</abstract>

                <description>Well you will in fact receive a stiff bill, generate huge log files and eventually run out of disk space. But on the upside, you will also have collected a treasure trove of legit credentials &amp; interesting stuff like valid OAuth refresh tokens, JWT tokens, bearers, cookies, emails, meeting invites with passwords &amp; truckloads of internet scanner noise.

In this session we will revisit bitflip research from the last decade and weponize it. Showcase 'Certainly' a pioneering offensive / defensive tool that employs Wildcard DNS matching &amp; on-the-fly generated SSL certificates and custom payloads for incoming requests across various protocols. All with the intention to downgrade security, harvest credentials, capture emails and replacing dependencies with custom "malicious" payloads</description>

                <abstract>This talk is a "no clip" deep dive through a genre of music. We'll start in 1990 and discover the genre as it was discovered by its creators. While traveling through time we'll try to answer the question: what is hardcore?
There will clips and mixes of revolutions and sub-genres. We'll learn how it's made and how to win the loudness war. Hardcore spawned a youth culture with lasting international adoption. From art to cheese, we'll cover it all. We'll learn the dance and end with a live set.</abstract>

                <description>This talk has it all: licensing, content, audience and noise problems in just one comfortable session.

During the talk we'll listen to the evolution of this genre using samples, short mixes and video clips. We'll touch upon the politics of resistance and adoption, politicization of nice people and the death and renaissance of the genre. There is a lot to talk about and to listen to. The "one hour" version of the talk was a hit at Hacker Hotel 2025, and immediately had a two hour sequel in the off-the-record room.

While going down this rabbit hole, and to expand on the "one hour" version, we'll take some more time to dive into audio engineering and how to win the loudness war. It will ruin some things some for some people, while opening doors for others.

The central question throughout the session will be: "what is hardcore?".

This talk mostly focusing on fun and interesting stuff, but due to the inherent nature of hardcore music there might (=guarantee) be references to sex, drugs, violence, profanity, recklessness and spooky scary skeletons in the first ten seconds. This talk is not for all ages and minds.

The plan is to have about one to two hours diving into this rabbit hole. After that we'll try to teach you the dance called "hakkuh" and end off with a super varied one hour live set (if time and noise curfew allows) touching multiple genres with different types of hardcore at its center.</description>

                <abstract>Web scraping continues to be a cornerstone of OSINT operations, particularly during Red Team engagements and external attack surface reconnaissance. Yet, as anti-bot technologies grow more sophisticated, traditional scraping methods based on direct HTTP requests are increasingly ineffective.
This talk takes a technical dive into browser-based scraping techniques that closely mimic real user behavior to evade detection, inspired by real-world mechanisms observed across major web platforms.</abstract>

                <description>In Red Team operations and external attack surface assessments, open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a critical step for identifying internet-exposed assets and assessing the associated risks. One of the most common techniques in this phase is web scraping, which automates the collection of publicly available data—often without relying on official APIs that are frequently rate-limited, monitored, or entirely unavailable.

In previous conferences, such as Fabien Vauchelles’s talk "Cracking the Code: Decoding Anti-Bot Systems", the focus was on detecting scraping activities at the network layer using TCP/IP fingerprinting and IP intelligence. This presentation builds on that work by shifting the focus to client-side techniques—specifically, browser-based approaches that mimic legitimate user behavior to evade detection.

The objective of this session is to explore modern strategies for conducting stealthy web scraping by avoiding API usage and minimizing anomalies detectable at both the network and application layers. Based on real-world use cases, the talk aims to provide actionable insights for security professionals involved in scraping—whether performing it or defending against it.The talk will present concrete methods for data collection, including:

- Making direct HTTP/HTTPS requests to web servers—such as websites or HTTP-based services—using libraries that handle protocol-level communication. This method allows efficient data retrieval by bypassing the need to render the page or load additional resources like images, videos, stylesheets, or scripts. It’s fast and lightweight, especially suited for static or partially dynamic content.

- Leveraging headless browsers to simulate real browser behavior without a graphical interface. These tools embed full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript engines, enabling interaction with modern, dynamic web applications. This technique is essential when scraping content that relies on client-side rendering or asynchronous JavaScript operations.

- Using browser-side scripting tools, such as TamperMonkey, within standard browsers. These tools allow custom JavaScript code to be injected and executed directly on the page, offering a practical and discreet way to automate data collection from within the browsing environment itself. This technique has been successfully applied in large-scale scraping operations, including on major social networks where traditional approaches are often ineffective due to advanced client-side defenses.

Beyond the scraping techniques themselves, the presentation will also cover the current detection methods employed by websites to identify automated behavior and how these can be bypassed, including:

- Detection of automation environments via specific JavaScript variables (e.g., navigator.webdriver) or discrepancies in the DOM.
- Behavioral detection mechanisms such as mouse movements, keyboard activity, or interaction timing.
- Identification of scraping-specific browser extensions or content injection tools.
- Detection of headless execution environments using debugging interfaces or timing-based heuristics.

This talk will provide a technically grounded exploration of the current capabilities and limitations of stealth web scraping from both offensive and defensive perspectives.</description>

                <description>Donating a kidney is quite a thing. But it also isn't. But mostly, it is. I will talk about all the aspects (personal, technical, logistical, ethical, financial) of the process. Lots of related but entirely different things. How does it affect me? How long did it take? What does everything look like? What do the numbers mean? What does it feel like? Can you do the same? Should you do the same? Who shouldn't do it? WHY?</description>

                <abstract>This is a first introduction to quantum computers. We will discuss what makes quantum mechanics so special, and how it allows building fundamentally different algorithms. I’ll do a short live demo of how you can program a quantum computer yourself using the Python package *Qiskit*. Then, we will look at one of the most impactful applications: breaking widely used public-key cryptography like RSA, and how this will impact the cybersecurity sector.</abstract>

                <description>This is a first introduction to quantum computers: no prior background needed. We will discuss how quantum mechanics, a theory of microscopic particles, contains counter-intuitive effects like superposition and entanglement. Schrödinger’s cat is an iconic example, where the poor animal is both dead and alive at the same. Interestingly, the same laws of nature make it possible to build an extended set of algorithms, with speedups beyond what we can achieve ‘classically’. 

I’ll show how we can program today’s quantum computers and show a short live demonstration of the Python package Qiskit. We will learn how to write code that creates something equivalent to Schrödinger’s cat. 

Then, we will look at one of the most impactful applications. Quantum computers turn out to be incredible hacking machines, making it straightforward to crack widely-used encryption schemes such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. We will discuss how long it will take until we have sufficiently large devices, and what alternative cryptography we can fall back to.</description>

                <description>The talk is about four years of hands-on experience as a CISO in a fast growing fintech company. During this time, I've had the unique opportunity to build an effective and operational security structure from the ground up within a completely cloud-based setup.

My experience provides a practical roadmap for understanding the critical nuances of approaching security in a full-cloud, product-driven organization. 

We'll delve into topics like:
* The initial complexities: What happens when you're securing infrastructure that's always changing?
* Navigating DevSecOps: How do you embed security seamlessly into a fast-paced development culture?
* Real-world pitfalls: Concrete examples of challenges faced and how we overcame them.
* Building an effective security posture: Practical insights into creating an operational security framework that actually works in the cloud.

The goal is to share actionable takeaways and lessons learned, helping others anticipate and navigate similar challenges in their own cloud security journeys.</description>

                <abstract>A shared understanding of what time it is and the rate at which time progresses is essential in many areas of technology from industrial control to broadcast. There are two main ways of synchronizing time between multiple computers, Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Precision Time Protocol (PTP). NTP is sufficient for certificate validation, but when timing is crucial we need PTP.  In this talk we will take a deep dive into PTP: what it is, how it works, and various ways to abuse it.</abstract>

                <description>In my previous talks about Audio over IP and AV technologies the Precision Time Protocol has come up repeatedly as something that deserves its own talk. PTP has a wider use case which makes it interesting as a target for shenanigans. The talk aims to consolidate several years of experience and research into a concise understanding of this fundamental technology.

No prior knowledge about PTP or network time will be assumed. Some familiarity with networking basics will be helpful, but not essential.

Warning may contain hacker humor.</description>

                <abstract>Sometimes ago, I embarked on a journey into the world of electronics and FPGA technology with no 
prior knowledge. What began as passion for retro gaming evolved into a quest for preservation via reverse engineering and FPGA-based emulation. This presentation will share my journey, highlighting the challenges of learning Verilog, the tools, the  resources, and the lessons I learned along the way. By sharing my experiences I hope to inspire others to contribute to preservation of video games.</abstract>

                <description>**Abstract:**

In an era where classic arcade games risk becoming obsolete, preserving them is  crucial. This presentation chronicles a journey from curiosity to creation, demonstrating how FPGAs can be used to create accurate emulator.

**Introduction to FPGAs:**  

FPGAs are versatile integrated circuits that offer unparalleled flexibility for hardware design. 
Unlike fixed CPUs or GPUs, FPGAs allow for reconfiguration, making them ideal for creating custom 
solutions like game emulators. This section will explore the advantages of FPGA-based emulation over 
traditional software emulators, and the existing plateform like the MiSTeR FPGA.

**Verilog Programming:**  

Verilog is a hardware description language used for defining digital circuits in FPGAs. This 
part introduces Verilog's role in designing these circuits, and how it differ to traditional 
programming languages. 

**Reverse Engineering PCBs:**  

This segment breaks down the process of reverse engineering an arcade PCB. From 
identifying components and they're connections, to reverse custom IC and schematics creation.

**Creating an arcade games core**  

A case study on the creation of an arcade game FPGA core. Challenges faced during development, and specifities of arcade games emulation. 

**Conclusion :** 

The presentation concludes by encouraging attendees to embark on their own journey, offering practical advice and resources tofacilitate their exploration into FPGA-based gaming preservation. The goal is to inspire and equip newcomers with the knowledge and tools to preserve classic arcade games through FPGA emulation.</description>

                <abstract>Security teams want to prevent incidents - but what if controlled breaking prevents catastrophic failures? Drawing from aviation safety, chaos engineering, and resilience design, discover why 'unbreakable' security comes from breaking things on purpose. Learn to transform incident culture from blame to learning, implement controlled failure practices, and build psychological safety that turns near-misses into competitive advantages.</abstract>

                <description>Hi, I am Dana and work as a teamtrainer / outdoor guide. I work with kids, teens, adults - and I am ever so often amazed how easy and fast we are connecting with each other while moving and laughing and trying to do more or less ridiculous tasks. We would meet somewhere on a field and do a lot of playing and trying stuff. I am very looking forward to having fun and inspiring (a bit of) our muscles and minds together :o)
Most of the games and exercises are suitable for persons in wheelchairs or otherwise bodily constricted; we will take whatever challenge it takes to find adaptions for the tasks at hand, so everyone can join in.
HOW MANY: min 8, max 30 persons.
HOW OLD: min. 6 years old, only when accompanied by an adult.
HOW LONG: 30-90 min (however the requests...)
HOW OFTEN: I don´t know: maybe every day except the last? 
WHEN: a good time would be around 10:00 in the mornings or later in the evening, (maybe 17:00), depending how hot the weather would be and if we would find a place in shadows</description>

                <description>In this workshop, you will receive an introduction to the demoscene, a digital art community that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s with the advent of affordable home computers like the Commodore 64 and Amiga. The demoscene, still thriving today, brings enthusiasts together at "demoparties" to create "retro" demos on these vintage systems. Meanwhile, modern hardware enables the use of fantasy consoles like the TIC-80, which offer a retro aesthetic with modern programming languages such as Lua, Python, and JavaScript.

During the hands-on session, attendees will focus on programming the TIC-80 with Lua, gaining practical experience in creating basic demos. By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to craft their first simple TIC-80 demo or be ready to join creative events like the "byte jam." To make the most of this session, please bring a laptop with TIC-80 pre-installed.

Workshop Agenda
- Introduction to the demoscene and competitions, such as "byte jams"
- Hands-on session with TIC-80, programming in Lua
- Guidance on creating simple demos for TIC-80</description>

                <description>Instructor @DoodleMe, @KnottyLola, and team will take you through some of the most basic concepts of Japanese rope bondage (Shibari). You'll learn some theory, and a few beginner friendly knots that you can use at home and that lay the foundations to more advanced ties.

This peer based workshop is aimed at complete beginners. Singles, pairs and groups are welcome. Spots are limited based on the size of the workshop space. First come first serve. No dress code, but it's suggested you avoid loose clothing as this makes it harder to tie. 

Please bring your own (non-stretchy) rope if you have it. A bring a blanket or something else comfy to sit on the floor without shoes is useful too. Workshop will be taught in English.

The workshop is entirely "lab mode" and there is no sexual content, but it remains for over 18's only.</description>

                <description>No experience required, just enthusiasm (and maybe some liquid courage). Whether you’re in it to win it or just here for the vibes, everyone’s welcome. Expect classics, surprises, and that one person who really nails "Bohemian Rhapsody."</description>

                <description>By: Hamza Tafsi and Alexandros Tokatlis (DIVD)
Making the grid smart is part of the solution, but present its owns set of challenges, because by controlling and manipulating a lot of small consumers or producers at the same time, an attacker can still have a large effect on the grid.
DIVD currently has a research project (https://www.divd.nl/energie/) devoted to this and Hamza and Alexandros are researchers in this project.
In this talk they will show you how they attack smart energy systems using a Honeywell Smart Thermostat as an example device.
After the presentation the presenters will stick around the D42D area/cluster where there will be plenty of devices for you to try and hack and maybe even earn your own CVE.</description>

                <description>A collection of interactive installations connects art with (complex) science. Theories and model systems from the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics and more are at the base of intriguing images, sounds and texts that you yourself produce. Or is it the other way around?
Caution: The access to the labyrinth is at your own risk. Wear comfortable clothes. High heels are not recommended. Children have to be supervised at all times. Unfortunately the Labyrinth is not accessile to wheelchair users.</description>

Bij de levering van Mifi devices doet zich een vreemde situatie voor. Met behulp van hardware-hacking probeer ik te bevestigen of te ontkrachten of er werkelijk iets speelt.
Deze talk zal in het Nederlands gegeven worden en is primair voor DutchPicknick-ers. Anderen zijn ook welkom, maar de exacte tijd moet nog even bepaald worden. Zit je niet in DutchPicknick, meldt je vooraf even bij ons village.</description>

[https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Recipe:Kefir_making_manual_-_short_workshop_form Workshop manual is shared here].

This is hands on workshop during which you will learn how to make, harvest and continue to prepare [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir kefir] using kefir grain culture which you will walk away with if you don't defend yourself too hard. We will explain basic concepts of probiotic, prebiotic and biofilm based polycultures and why it is good to consume foods “labeled” by these terms. You will prepare your own kefir culture, based on the  [https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Recipe:Kefir_making_manual_-_short_workshop_form working manual] and take it with you so you will be ready to brew wherever you decide hopefully “positively infecting” your local hackerspace. We will make at least one recipe together, either "kefir cake" or kefir smoked paprika spread, if we have time we may do a base for probiotic kefir drink using kefir whey.

We will demonstrate how to make a new batch of kefir and how to harvest the old one, you will than do it by yourself. The main aim of this workshop is for the participants to understand the principles behind the milk fermentation with kefir culture and not to be afraid to just do it. Combined with the practical experience which I provide you will be able to take care properly about your kefir culture which is the key for your successful long term fermentation adventures! Don't worry too much about loosing a batch or two, that happens from time to time, keeping the "mother culture" happy is the important part. As usually there will be tasters, cultures sharing, manuals and various hints how to use the products in alternative ways making for example probiotic drinks from whey, kefir cheese spreads, kefir cake et cetera. I can be also your troubleshooting help if you need it. 

This workshop is donation based no one turned away for lack of funds, if you can chip in around 10€, that would be great but it is up to you.</description>

Each cheese tasting session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for this one (like three times overbooked). If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.

This event is based on '''donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds'''.

So lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!

To add your own cheese, add it to the wiki below

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

Have you ever been curious about the process behind this amazing drink called beer or do you just like beer in general? We will be brewing a SMaSH (single malt and single hop) beer on site on Day 1 and then enjoy the product on Day 4 on wards.

Beer is brewed using a brewing system and then later served through a cold tap. Make sure to bring some type of container suitable for beer consumption, as there will be a tap available during the brewing session!

Location is close to the Sauna/Salmiakki.</description>

                <abstract>This talk is a roller-coaster ride through a few years of experience in teaching the government about their obligations w.r.t. climate change.  It details the procedural hacks they use, and ways to evade them.  It also gives examples of elegantly designed cases with a potential of very high impact.  Climate law is a domain of logic, language and social ethics, all available in the average hacker's toolbox.  I'd argue the world needs our minds to lap up the debris left behind by our governments.</abstract>

                <description>At [MCH2022](https://mch2022.org/#/) I ran into skilled, intelligent young people who were numb about climate change.  This is trending, and it broke my reliance on governments to fix this huge problem.  It is, after all, a [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) so by default everyone waits for others to make the first move.  I adopted a grassroots approach and started taking government to court, alone or as part of [Scientist Rebellion](https://www.scientistrebellion.nl/).  Because it really is politics that is failing us.  Court cases help executive government to do their jobs, by forcing them to stick to climate laws in spite of politicians without vision, heart or spine.

Climate law is mostly international law, which means that it trumps national law, even including anything that a national Supreme Court says.  But courts are not the problem, they are well-versed in the travesty of what governments are _not_ doing.  They need to be asked to rule on a case though, before they can take a decision.  And it takes some work before you get to that point.

I am not saying that government is evil.  I am saying it is stifled in its ways, it cannot progress because it is obstructed by the past, present, procedures and politics.  The everyday working space for civil servants is one of national or even local law.  They have insufficient focus on international (climate) law or rely on other parties to remedy it.  Also, they cannot always move freely, caught up between their oath of faith and a lack of mandate to interpret laws.

With low court fees and no lawyer requirement, administrative law is  the cheapest way to go about correcting government, but it takes a fair amount of skill to navigate.  I'm still learning, but I can share from experience the most important pitfalls to prepare for.  Most of this has parallels in countries outside the Netherlands.  What remains is logic, language and ethics.  Oh, and some perseverance and creativity. All these skills are native to hackers, and often abundantly so.

It can take some designer skill to construct a case that has a chance of making it.  And looking at things from different perspectives, while still sticking to concrete goals.  During this talk, I will give a few examples.  If you want to read up on things, have a look at my [Draaiboek Klimaatzaak](http://klimaatzaak.groengemak.nl/) (in Dutch) or similar resources by others.

Finally, it can feel abrasive to step out and impose demands on local government, a national ministry or a central bank.  At least, I usually think shyly of what I am doing.  But abresiveness is not among my submission filters; I care for being reasonable and having a right to what I'm demanding.  And as long as I remain respectful towards the humans on the other side of a case, it is quite simply a democratic right to take corrective or coercive action if the government fails so utterly as it is doing w.r.t. climate change.

**IANAL**  but what I am is _seriously pissed_ with irresponsible governments around the globe.  It is their job to protect our future survival, the evidence and urgency is overwhelmingly clear, but still they leave the free market to corporations with short-term profit as their essential goal.  Corporations will bend when curtailed, provided it is done equally to all, and there is only one party with the power of doing that.  But government is treating a life-threatening condition as yet another management problem to fit into a 9-to-5 job.  So much is done wrong that I find it unethical to sit and wait for a rare breed of climate lawyers to stand up to government mismanagement.  Not if all it takes is a few hundred Euros, strict logical reasoning, a few letters full of detailed knowledge in a design with components from a couple of data sheets (a.k.a. climate laws) and perhaps the mentality of living in a makable world (a.k.a. democracy).</description>

                <abstract>As of August 1st, 2025, the EU’s Radio Equipment Directive enforces new cybersecurity requirements. For the first time, broad categories of everyday devices , not just critical infrastructure or niche tech, must meet mandatory security standards. This talk breaks down how we got here, why it matters, and what’s breaking in the process. We’ll look at the political and technical hurdles in rolling this out, what it means for manufacturers, and how it connects to the looming Cyber Resilience Act.</abstract>

                <description>On August 1st, 2025, three new cybersecurity requirements under the EU’s Radio Equipment Directive (RED) officially kicked in. This is the first time the EU has imposed hard security requirements on a wide range of everyday consumer products. Think routers, smart watches, toys with a Wi-Fi chip, and more. This part of RED is often called RED DA (Delegated Act), and it's a big deal: security is no longer optional.

In this talk, we'll unpack what RED DA is actually about: how it came to be, why it was pushed through before the upcoming Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and how that sequencing leads to some strange and messy overlaps between the two. Spoiler: it’s a political and regulatory patchwork.

We’ll look at how standardization efforts around RED DA have developed, but also at how many manufacturers are still figuring out how best to comply, while market surveillance authorities are navigating their own challenges, often working with limited tools, guidance, or resources.

On top of all this, the reality is, RED/DA is just a warm-up for the main event: the Cyber Resilience Act. We’ll take a look at what CRA brings to the table, what the current state of standardization looks like there, and what kinds of challenges are already popping up on the horizon. If you’re building, selling, or securing connected products in the EU, or just curious about how regulation is reshaping product security, this talk will give you a clear picture of what’s going on and what’s coming next.</description>

                <description>The talk will cover:
1) An overview of RFID types, including both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) cards, briefly touching upon ultra-high-frequency (UHF) systems as well.
2) A breakdown of encryption protocols used in RFID security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.
3) A review of documented attacks, including cloning, sniffing, relay, cryptographic, and side-channel techniques.  

Additionally, analysis of the latest developments in magic RFID cards will be presented.
Findings are based on an aggregation of academic research, industry reports, and hands-on testing of RFID systems in real-world environments.</description>

                <abstract>The SOHO Smashup is a famous category in the IoT focused edition of Pwn2Own. Contestants are challenged to exploit a router from the WAN side and then use that device to exploit a second device on the internal LAN. Last year, we took them up on this challenge and successfully demonstrated a 0day exploit chain against a QNAP router and pivoting to a TrueNAS system. In this presentation, we'll describe how we performed our research and the vulnerabilities we found.</abstract>

                <description>The Dutch NCSC issued a warning last year that they see an increase of threat actors that shift their attention from endpoints to edge devices, including routers. This demonstrates the relevance of the SOHO Smashup category in Pwn2Own. Vulnerabilities in routers that could be exploited from the WAN side pose a real security risk for companies; as these devices are often badly monitored and not kept up to date. Threat actors who are able to compromise a router are in a key position to further advance into the internal network of a company.

In this talk we'll describe the vulnerabilities and exploits. Specifically, we'll describe our research method on the QNAP router. We tried to increase our attack surface step by step, until we found a reliable exploitation path.</description>

many new developments, and I've learned how to explain the matter better.  I

and 2) helps you appreciate the other talk ('reverse engineering the whole

                <description>DNA is the code of life.  Surprisingly, it is easier to understand DNA as
"biologically flavored digital data" than the other way around, "a really
long molecule with digital aspects".  Human DNA is 750 megabytes, organized
in chromosomes and within that stored in genes and intergenic matter.  There
are things like calling conventions, "start of gene markers".  There are #ifdefs in there.  
There is bloated code.  There are hacks.  In this talk, I give a tour of our modern understanding 
of DNA, which should be exciting for nearly everyone into computers.</description>

                <description>During the session we will look back on what was said in 2017 and what we know now to be true and have seen in practice. We will also reflect on where we currently are and where we stood back then and if we made any real progress in that regard. Topics discussed will be:
- Was the theoretical analysis correct? and are there any additional nuances there? more recent examples in practice?
- We hacked SMA back then because we thought they were most secure. Have any other grid-ending vulnerabilities in PV-installations popped up since then? 
- Are we better off today, then we were back then?
- Prophesising the future: where are we headed with this attack?</description>

At Bellingcat, a Dutch investigative non-profit, we publish open-source journalism using open-source software tools. In this presentation, I'll talk about a new tool I've been building for querying airplane data, and the broader journalistic context of this data, which has become increasingly important for tracking oligarchs, deportations and conflict.</abstract>

                <abstract>Since the start of the war, our community has risen to help Ukraine in many different ways. This talk explains what happens when your friends find themselves in a war and ask for help. Luckily, even though it can be overwhelming, everyone can do something. This talk shows you how.</abstract>

                <description>The IT community in Kharkiv is doing their best to help their city and country to counter the effects of the invasion and war. Together with the Dutch hacker community we try to help them, with practical support, such as medical goods, computers and network equipment and vehicles. 

The project is a true community effort, creating new contacts and relations between our communities. This connection makes it harder to watch the news, but it also offers a practical way to support Ukraine, knowing that all the energy we put in here is useful and welcomed.

As the war keeps raging we started a foundation to channel all the humanitarian support: Aid to Ukraine. It even has ANBI status. Our website has all the info: https://aidtoukraine.nl</description>

                <description>Belgium has laws regulating the reporting and public disclosure of vulnerabilities. While the goal is to protect both organisations and reporters of vulnerabilities, the assumptions behind it conflict with the practice of coordinated vulnerability disclosure. I will discuss the parts of my experience I’m allowed to tell.</description>

                <abstract>Enter the fascinating world of corruption, chicanery, low-tech fraud, and forensic tools that uncover it. The story is told through the eyes of a Russian election official who has participated in campaigns of all levels in the past 4 years and fought for justice (mostly unsuccessfully). Watch a demo how to tamper with a security bag and learn how to use statistics to detect ballot stuffing [1]. See the obstacles faced by Russians wanting a change. See how the government “wins” the elections.</abstract>

                <abstract>For over 23 years, the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and its predecessors - GOVCERT.NL and CERT-RO - have been publishing security advisories to help protect Dutch digital infrastructure. Over the decades, this advisory service has evolved significantly in scope, scale, and approach. From the tooling and processes used, to the volume of vulnerabilities handled, the format of our advisories, and our audience - nearly every aspect of our work has changed and keeps changing.</abstract>

                <description>No single archive is permanent, nor large enough to store all of our cultures at risk. Modern archival methods are robust, but no archive or institute alone can withstand the threats we are currently facing. The destruction of knowledge and cultural heritage has happened, and is happening again. Whether it is caused by human action&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[\[1\]](#fn1)&lt;/sup&gt; or natural causes.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[\[2\]](#fn2)&lt;/sup&gt;. Without our archives we lose knowledge and culture which has a negative impact on our ability to learn, study and innovate. However, digital information can be copied easily and quickly. 

Safeguarding Research &amp; Culture (SRC) is creating an alternative infrastructure for archiving and disseminating of cultural heritage and scientific knowledge. We seek to preserve cultural memory in a way that traditional archives cannot. Together, we can ensure that our cultural, intellectual and scientific heritage exists in multiple copies, in multiple places, and that no single entity or group of entities can make it all disappear.

In this session, we will present why we are doing this, what our approach is and why we need your help. 

After attending this session, participants will:
* Gained an insight into the importance of data to support culture preservation &amp; research purposes 
* Understand how this project relates to and supplements more “traditional” archiving &amp; preservation infrastructure
* Feel empowered to contribute to the project in various ways, including seeding existing datasets, identifying at-risk datasets, downloading &amp; adding at-risk datasets to the swarm and supporting this project in other ways

                <description>You can hack all sorts of things. Software, hardware. But being a hacker, what makes more sense than to hack oneself? Hackers have been turning themselves into bionic man, but we can also just hack our brain, using just out brain. I am talking about lucid dreaming: dreaming while you are aware of doing so and able to shape your dream. This talk will discuss what we know so far about lucid dreams and how they relate to other special states of the mind. The main focus will be on how to hack your own mind to start experiencing lucid dreams, what you can do in them, and how they differ from real life.</description>

                <abstract>This talk will take you into a journey leading to the retrofit of a robotic tape library to enable it to accomodate hard drives in addition to the original media, from the reasons we did it to all the obstacles that needed to be overcome and how we did all that, pushing a little further the physical limits that make data storage increasingly problematic in a world where over 200TB is generated every second and must sometimes be retained for years (and possibly more).</abstract>

                <description>Every year, humanity generates at least 250 Exabytes of data, so storage becomes increasingly problematic because this accumulates and at least part of it must be stored and made accessible for extended periods ; however, not all of that data is being accessed simultaneously. Moreover, the Internet is not well suited for the transfer of large datasets and quite often it is preferable to move physical media.

In this talk we will dive into some physical limits related to this particular problem, and how we have pushed them a little further by retrofitting a large tape library so that it can accommodate hard drives in addition to magnetic tapes.

This task involved reverse-engineering the drive train, designing new electronics to replace the proprietary and monolithic hardware by something more manageable, coming up with a plan to build a docking station that can be handled by the robot and withstand millions of insertion cycles and that is also end-user-friendly while keeping it as affordable as possible. We will dive into the limitations of the various tools at our disposal and how we worked around them to achieve our goal, while drawing a picture of all the skills and technologies involved and how this can be useful for you.</description>

                <abstract>Let's talk to people about negotiating consent before engaging in personal and physical interactions. Your browser does it with every web server, so why shouldn't you do the same with people? This sounds harder than it actually is. Using the HTTP protocol as a guide this I will talk you through how you could negotiate consent to engage with someone on a variety of levels: From 'GET Hug' all the way to 200 OK, but also how to deal with a 404 Consent not found response.</abstract>

                <description>Consent is hot. Consent is good. Consent should be explicitly communicated. This sounds harder than it actually is. In this talk I will present on how to conduct consent negotiations for various levels of interpersonal contact. As illustration I will use the HTTP protocol guide the you through the consent negotiations for an encounter. 

Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with the HTTP protocol, I'll be sure that it all will be easy to understand including for those that don't dabble in raw HTTP traffic on a daily basis.

After the initial SYN-ACK from the TCP handshake we will get on with the initial HTTP Verbs such as GET and OPTIONS to initiate a consent negotiation and going through various permutations and outcomes. It will include simple Happy Flows, but also more complicated redirects, errors and how to gracefully deal with an unhappy flow if the response returned is not a 200 OK with a body that you hoped for.</description>

                <abstract>CubeSats are small satellites comprised of 10x10x10cm "units" and range in size from very small 1U or smaller PocketQubes to 24U beasts. What can be achieved with such a satellite platform and why?

I will go in to a brief history with examples from customers and amateur radio CubeSats.</abstract>

                <description>During my 20 years working with CubeSats, starting with designing parts of the Delfi-C3 student satellite in 2005, I have seen many missions and I have been involved in the design of quite a few CubeSats. Often, people ask me "what can you do with such a small satellite" and that prompted me to create this talk!</description>

                <abstract>Gosling is a Tor onionservice-based protocol and Rust reference-implementation which allows developers to build privacy-preserving p2p applications with the following properties:
- persistent authenticated peer identity
- end-to-end encrypted
- anonymity
- metadata resistance
- decentralisation
- real-time communication

This talk will go over the complexities involved in combining all of these properties (with a focus on metadata resistance) and describe how Gosling solves these problems.</abstract>

                <abstract>The MCH2022 Badge is an wonderful piece of hardware, with a great screen, a dual-core ESP32 CPU, and an Lattice FPGA to act as a co-processor. What if we could use the power of the FPGA to render 3D graphics? In this talk I'll take you through the basics of 3D rendering, the challenges of doing this on the Badge, and how I made the little Lattice produce pretty polygons.</abstract>

                <description>I don't know about you, but when I get my hands on a piece of hardware with a lovely screen and a bit of processing power, my first thought is "Can I make this produce 3D graphics?" (Well, the *real* first question is "Can it run Doom?" but that was already answered by the wonderful Sylvain Lefebvre.) So when the MCH2022 Badge was announced to come with an FPGA to play around with, well I knew where my free time would end up for a while.

The FPGA on the MCH2022 badge is, to put it mildly, *petite* at just 5K LUTs. And while it has plenty of memory space, memory bandwidth is limited. A traditional framebuffer-based 3D renderer wasn't going to work. So I had to get creative and instead render in vertical strips, while using as few operations per pixels as possible.

In this talk I'll explain how rasterization (the process of turning triangles into pixels) typically works, why this is challenging to do on the Badge hardware, and what I did instead. I'll talk about texturing and texture compression. And I'll talk about some crunchy digital details like memory bandwidth, caching, and clock transitions.</description>

                <description>"Works with (Amazon) Alexa" or "Works with Hey Google" are expressions of how fragmented the market of Internet of Things is. Those who want to automate their devices, are often faced with complicated compatibility matrices, cloud services and short-lived support cycles.

The W3C seeks to counter fragmentation of the Internet of Things, finding common ground and enabling long-term support.

As a hobbyist, I've been developing the Web of Things standards for many years. I've developed a server and a client which I will showcase along with a general introduction to the standards.

                <description>Governments should be radically more transparent, because public information and open data allow researchers, businesses, and voters to make better decisions. But too often, public data is fragmented, incomplete, hard to access, or never published at all.

At [Open State Foundation](https://openstate.eu/), we’ve spent more than a decade working to unlock that information. In this talk, we’ll share how we use a hacker's mindset to reverse-engineer transparency: 

- from tracking how long ministries take to answer Access to Information requests (the answer will surprise you), 
- to scraping hundreds of document portals into one search engine, 
- to building public calendars of ministerial meetings that anyone can subscribe to.

But above all, we’ll ask: how can hackers help open up the government?</description>

                <description>The keynotes of the likes of Microsoft, Google and Apple can all be summarized in 10 words: “A.I., A.I., A.I., Large Language Model, A.I., A.I., GPT, A.I. …“, so no doubt artificial intelligence holds a promise for the future. But what promise? Will A.I. save use or doom us? Or is it too soon to tell?

With the invention of the car, the car accident, vehicle man slaughter and the getaway car were also invented, as well as the police car and motorized ambulances. How does this apply to artificial intelligence?

What is the current state of A.I., what does it mean to our perception of the truth, and can it help us make the world more secure? How do classical security measures apply to the A.I. world, where do they fall short, and can we expect new or improved measures with the help of A.I.? Spoiler: yes, they do, and yes, we can.

In this talk, Frank will look at the A.I. wave from his unique and down to earth perspective. And hopefully you will walk away with a better understanding of AI in the context of (cyber) security.</description>

                <abstract>Are you a smartphone user worried about spyware, advanced actors, backdoors, zero-days or side-channel attacks? These routinely bypass end-to-end encryption through keyloggers, screen capture and compromised keys. Smartphones are part of complex ecosystems with dozens of hardware and software components and remain vulnerable despite vendor and political efforts.

We introduce a simple, offline, airgapped device to counter such threats.

                <abstract>Let's learn about L2 isolation with VLANs and dive into basic network architecture with OPNsense. After playing a bit with IPv4, let's discuss unicorn-issues IPv6 for your homelab-ing. Then expanding with WireGuard for simple inter-machine networks. Finally, we will take a look into a few tricks you can do with your systems to bypass "security"(-by-obscurity) and also how to defend against it.</abstract>

                <description>This talk will discuss the security considerations one should make for their own network at home. The first step, to achieve network segmentation, is the use of VLANs - but how do they work? Then advancing into isolated networks using OPNsene and how to configure routing between them (in a more or less scalable way, purely based on experience).
After breaking up (with) your networks, we will take a look into IPv6 troubles you'll likely encounter when you begin applying more strict rulesets onto your network and start leaving NAT-ting behind you. This will also include a quick summary of the most important IPv6-terms you'll need.
Instead of exposing your services publicly, one can also establish site-to-site (S2S) links with well-known parties, so we will take a quick look into getting WireGuard up and running - once again with some pitfalls you may encounter.
In the end, we will take a brief detour into how one could exploit one of my own mistakes (DNS-based routing without application of source-ip filtering).</description>

                <description>— Can I see your face?
— You are looking at it.

What is up with the beings with the visors going 'beep boop, this one is not a person'? Why identify as a robot in a time where computers pretend to be human? How does one turn a respirator and an LED matrix panel into a face? Unit Δ-44203 is a robot programmed to be helpful and will be happy to explain [how and why it built a visor](https://query.44203.online/topic/visor/). This talk covers technical aspects: respirator choice, tinting with foil or dye, electronics and programming. It will also discuss social aspects: robot identity and interactions with others. Humans are fascinating creatures and say the weirdest things to it!

                <abstract>Have you ever thought that Mathematics is a boring science about multiplying matrices, calculating integrals and approximating functions? Well, you've been wrong.

Mathematics is much bigger than that and in this talk we are going to look at one of the foundational object in Topology - a manifold. And, most importantly, we won't need any formulas or calculations to introduce it.

                <description>As a PhD in Geometry and Topology, working in Software Engineering, I rarely have an opportunity to use Mathematics in day-to-day tasks. You don't really need Abstract Algebra to write a YAML-file.

Yet, I think there is a number of mathematical concepts, which do not require an in-depth knowledge and complex abstractions, but can enrich our language and the way how we think about problems, how we collaborate, and how we structure the work around complex tasks.

Unfortunately, it often happens that mathematical abstraction get hidden behind the tons of Calculus, which you are expected to master before you are allowed to dive deeper. It doesn't have to be this way and I will prove it :)

So let's talk about the topology the fun way.</description>

                <abstract>Cyber Saiyan community has designed and developed a special gadget for WHY2025

The badge was designed to recall the dragon spheres, and will be an updated version of RomHack Camp 2022, both in term of design and features:
- single core ESP32-C3 SOC
- WiFi and Bluetooth 5
- 7 RGB leds in the front
- TFT display
- an updated firmware

During the talk we will present the hardware design and the firmware so anyone can try to summon Shenron :)</abstract>

                <abstract>Developing applications on Embedded Linux and Microcontrollers is a slow process. The various different languages and libraries can make it difficult to oversee the bigger picture. In addition, the development flow wildly diverges between platforms, making entering a new project or RTOS a big undertaking.

Now, you can create Embedded Linux and Microcontroller applications using Swift - a fast, modern, cross-platform ecosystem with thread- and memory safety.</abstract>

                <abstract>We all live in a fair democracy 🎶 ... or do we?

No, we live in a world where the major corporations decide how we interact with digital systems and digital systems govern the world. That's corporatocracy - a system in which corporations, rather than elected officials, have major influence over decision-making, laws, and societal direction. And they are not on our side.</abstract>

                <description>This talk is about what happens when the system isn't built for you — because it never was.
- If something goes wrong and you're not the 1,000th person to report it, it's your problem. Customer service? That's just a chatbot pretending to care.
- A mobile operator refused to sign a contract with me because they couldn't remove “I agree to receive ads.”
- My orders get randomly cancelled because I refuse to have a phone number.
- My industry certifications? Gone. Because I stood up for my privacy rights.

We'll go through these experiences and dissect why things are this way. Why must we adapt to their systems, but they won't adapt to ours? Why does a company's "official support channel" usually mean "no support at all"? Why do startups optimize for growth at the cost of basic usability?

This isn't just a rant (though there will be rants). It's a call to stop playing by their rules. We'll discuss examples of where people have pushed back and won, and where we've completely failed. If you've building an app or website, and intend to respect your users, this talk is for you.</description>

                <abstract>Generative Art is a form of art where the artist build a machine that autonomously produces artworks. 
 In this talk I'll introduce you to the wonderful world of computer generated art. Through live demo's and fiddling, you'll learn how you too can be an artist. I'll show plenty of examples using open source tools on how generative art can be an alternative path to learn to code.
Because sometimes, science and technology are simply beautiful.</abstract>

                <abstract>In the realm of cybersecurity, workplaces can be surprisingly unsafe, with a higher turnover of CISOs and alarming rates of misconduct. This talk explores the mechanisms behind this paradox, examining organizational dynamics, the pressures on CISOs, and the emergence of toxic behaviors. By analyzing real-world some very personal examples, we will uncover the root causes of these issues and provide practical solutions to foster a safer, more resilient cybersecurity culture.</abstract>

                <description>Cybersecurity is a field where pressure is constant, and mistakes can have severe consequences. Yet, for many cybersecurity professionals, the greatest threats do not come from external attackers but from within their own organizations. In one striking example, a security researcher discovered severe vulnerabilities in a widely used product, only to be dismissed as "overreacting" by management—a classic case of gaslighting. At Equifax, a CISO faced public blame for a devastating breach, despite years of underfunding and ignored warnings about outdated software. In another case, security engineers at SolarWinds raised concerns about critical vulnerabilities that were ignored—vulnerabilities that were later exploited in a massive supply chain attack affecting thousands of organizations.

These toxic dynamics are not just isolated incidents; they are symptoms of a broader problem in the way organizations perceive and manage cybersecurity. Security is often seen as a cost center—a department that creates problems rather than solving them. This mindset fuels blame-shifting, where CISOs become scapegoats after breaches they lacked the power to prevent. Even worse, security professionals who try to escalate serious risks are sometimes ignored, marginalized, or even retaliated against. A report by (ISC)² found that 60% of cybersecurity professionals have experienced burnout, and nearly one-third have left jobs due to toxic work environments. Such conditions not only harm individuals but also weaken an organization’s overall security posture.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. This talk explores how more mature industries have learned to overcome similar toxic dynamics. What can we learn from those experiences? By drawing on these examples, this talk will identify practical steps to transform cybersecurity into a healthier, more resilient field where burning people is no longer the net result of dealing with security.</description>

                <description>On every floor of your enterprise office, a silent revolution is underway. Roombas are no longer content with just cleaning – they're gathering intelligence. This presentation unveils a custom-built, weaponized Roomba designed to infiltrate corporate environments and conduct covert surveillance operations.

We'll dive deep into the anatomy of our rogue Roomba, showcasing its enhanced capabilities:

- WiFi attack modules for network penetration
- High-fidelity audio recording for eavesdropping on sensitive conversations
- 360-degree camera for visual intelligence gathering 
- Covert data exfiltration methods using it's docking station

Demonstrations will show the Roomba in action, silently gliding through office spaces, intercepting WiFi traffic, shoulder surfing employees to capture screen footage and gather boardroom secrets while charging in the meeting room. We'll explore the technical aspects of building this spy-bot, hardware additions, and the implementation of remote control features.

This talk is aimed at Social engineers, red teamers, penetration testers, and security professionals looking to understand and defend against novel insider threats. Attendees should have a basic understanding of networking, IoT, and physical security concepts.</description>

                <abstract>If you want to try something new, unusual, and technically creative, try high-altitude ballooning! In this short presentation, I'll share my experiences from a series of three high-altitude balloon projects. These projects included launching sensor payloads to altitudes about 25km and live HD video transmission from the stratosphere. You will learn how to prepare your payload, how to track its position and telemetry data using solutions, and even how to rescue a landed payload from a tall tree!</abstract>

                <abstract>Old technology is amazing! Have a look at an old electromechanical Pinball Machine, and try to understand how this works, without any (digital) electronics. Find out these machines have much in common with modern computers. Step by step it becomes clear how an old (1973) Pinball machine is "programmed".</abstract>

                <description>A 1973 electromechanical Pinball Machine is an amazing machine. But how does this work without any (digital) electronics? By comparing this to a standard computer, the (mechanical) components are explained. An electromechanical Pinball Machine has many elements from a modern computer. It has I/O, memory, can do (simple) calculations, is programmed for logic operations, and is configurable, But does this make it an early computer or not? Come, listen, and decide for yourself!

When the weather conditions are good, the 1973 Pinball Machine will be operational in the Villlage:Back to the 80s Party. Hopefully you can come and play a game on this beautiful Bally Monte Carlo edition of 1973 yourself or with your friends! (Up to 4 concurrent players) Can you set the High Score of the day?</description>

                <description>WIQD (We in Quantum Development) aims to build a thriving, inclusive network for professionals in quantum science and technology. During this 15-minute presentation, we will briefly introduce WIQD and discuss the importance of DEI in quantum development. We will also share lessons learned from our 2024 Women’s Day Hackathon (event page), where participants collaborated to tackle technical and societal challenges in quantum. By reflecting on these experiences, we hope to inspire more people to get involved, collaborate across disciplines, and help shape an open, innovative quantum community. To make the talk interactive, we’ll use Mentimeter to collect thoughts and ideas from the audience in real time.</description>

                <abstract>In a context of technological integration, OT is getting more and more a green field for attackers and illegal activities. This phenomena is the natural result of the absence of mutual understanding and collaboration between IT and OT sectors that looking one each other as a totally unrelated entities. 
In this talk we'll explore some OT technologies trying to understand and highlight some of the most relevant aspects of the OT security and we'll have a look to a couple of real incidents in this</abstract>

                <abstract>"De ‘O’ in OT – Operationeel, Onmisbaar, Onbeschermd?"
Operational Technology (OT) is de ruggengraat van industrie en kritieke infrastructuur, maar blijft vaak onbeschermd. Traditionele IT-security werkt niet in OT, waar continuïteit essentieel is en stilstand geen optie. Hoe beschermen we OT zonder operaties te verstoren? In deze sessie bespreken we dreigingen, regelgeving (NIS2, CRA) en strategieën om OT echt veilig te maken. OT is onmisbaar – laten we zorgen dat het beschermd blijft.</abstract>

                <description>Operational Technology (OT) vormt de ruggengraat van onze industrie en kritieke infrastructuur. Het houdt productieprocessen draaiende, faciliteert energievoorziening en zorgt voor de stabiliteit van vitale systemen. Maar terwijl de digitalisering OT steeds meer verbindt met IT en IoT, blijven de fundamentele beveiligingsuitdagingen onderbelicht. De systemen die onmisbaar zijn, blijken vaak ook het meest kwetsbaar.

In deze sessie duiken we in de kern van OT-security anno 2025. Waarom werken traditionele IT-beveiligingsstrategieën niet in OT? Hoe kunnen organisaties de continuïteit van hun operationele processen waarborgen zonder hun productie stil te leggen? En hoe zorgen we ervoor dat compliance zoals NIS2 en de Cyber Resilience Act niet slechts een checklist is, maar een echte kans om OT te beschermen?

Aan de hand van praktijkvoorbeelden, dreigingsanalyses en best practices laten we zien waarom OT-beveiliging een andere benadering vereist. We bespreken:

De unieke kwetsbaarheden van OT en waarom traditionele security-aanpakken tekortschieten
De grootste OT-dreigingen van vandaag: ransomware, supply chain attacks en insider threats
De balans tussen operationele continuïteit en cybersecurity – want stilstand is geen optie
Hoe organisaties OT-security kunnen integreren zonder disruptie
OT-security is geen luxe, het is een noodzaak. De ‘O’ in OT staat niet alleen voor Operationeel, maar ook voor Onmisbaar – en als we niet opletten, Onbeschermd.

Benieuwd naar de realiteit achter OT-beveiliging? Kom en ontdek hoe we OT écht veilig kunnen maken.</description>

                <description>This presentation will cover the conception of the sega Saturn like how the downfall of the Saturn was at it's very beginning and we will also go over it's different processes like the dual SH2s, SCU and VDP and find out why it became so complex. 

You may ask why go over such an old console because its gives import lessons on what not to do when designing hardware. But I just find the hardware so interesting with it's different coprocessors 

So if you are interested in the Saturn or want to learn about the Saturns shortcomings and not what to do this is a presentation for you</description>

From Initial Access to Impact and Exfiltration. AI is happy to oblige the attacker. In this talk we will demonstrate access-to-impact AI vulnerability chains in most flagship enterprise AI assistants: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Einstein, and their custom agent . Some require one bad click by the victim, others work with no user interaction – 0click attacks.</abstract>

                <description>Compromising a well-protected enterprise used to require careful planning, proper resources, and ability to execute. Not anymore! Enter AI.

Initial access? AI is happy to let you operate on its users’ behalf. Persistence? Self-replicate through corp docs. Data harvesting? AI is the ultimate data hoarder. Exfil? Just render an image. Impact? So many tools at your disposal. There's more. You can do all this as an external attacker. No credentials required, no phishing, no social engineering, no human-in-the-loop. In-and-out with a single prompt.

Last year at BHUSA we demonstrated the first real-world exploitation of AI vulnerabilities impacting enterprises, living off Microsoft Copilot. A lot has changed in the AI space since... for the worse. AI assistants have morphed into agents. They read your search history, emails and chat messages. They wield tools that can manipulate the enterprise environment on behalf of users – or a malicious attacker once hijacked. We will demonstrate access-to-impact AI vulnerability chains in most flagship enterprise AI assistants: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Einstein, and their custom agent . Some require one bad click by the victim, others work with no user interaction – 0click attacks.

The industry has no real solution for fixing this. Prompt injection is not another bug we can fix. It is a security problem we can manage! We will offer a security framework to help you protect your organization–the GenAI Attack Matrix. We will compare mitigations set forth by AI vendors, and share which ones successfully prevent the worst 0click attacks. Finally, we’ll dissect our own attacks, breaking them down into basic TTPs, and showcase how they can be detected and mitigated.</description>

                <description>As a technical person, you work with complicated and often important matters. To explain these, get your message across, raise your value and get a better job, it is essential that you can communicate your message to a wider audience. If you cannot effectively explain your solution or your issues to other people you will end up frustrated and unrecognized. Even for educating and training your peers, public speaking skills are very important.

In this workshop, you will improve your public speaking skills. We will practice and evaluate and practice some more.

Your workshop leader is a professional trainer and an advanced member of Toastmasters International. Toastmasters International is a nonprofit educational organization for the purpose of helping members improve their communication skills. More than 300.000 members are organized in around 15.000 member clubs globally.</description>

                <description>There is a Battlesnake Tournament today. You can compete with other Battlesnakes, but what if you don't have one? Lets dive into the basics and get you a Battlesnake for the tournament!

This workshop is from level 0 to how far we get. What you need to know to participate, is some JavaScript or Python (the workshop is not about learning these languages, but guidance on the Python route will be given). You only need a laptop with internet and an account at 2 websites (steps will be provided upfront to give us more time to battle snakes!).

During the workshop we will build together a basic Battlesnake which is able to complete some levels of achievements. At the end of the workshop, you will be able to bring your Battlesnake to the tournament, which is in the same tent, right after the workshop!

After WHY2025, you can keep programming your Battlesnake to complete more levels. There are even online competitions you can participate in.</description>

                <description>So how does it work? Simply create a battlesnake on play.battlesnake.com and enter the tournament. Create it from scratch or using one of many starter repos available for different languages. To run your snake, run it as a server, expose it (e.g. through ngrok), and the game will send you API requests. The responses you send will determine how well your snake does!

Learn how to create your own snake [in the docs](https://docs.battlesnake.com/getting-started) or join [the Battlesnake workshop](https://program.why2025.org/why2025/talk/7CWZHR/) on the same day as the tournament.</description>

                <description>Free software, i.e. software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it, is vital for a better future. In order to spread computer user freedom, we need free software education. The goal of this workshop is to come up with specific messaging, create educational materials we can share with institutions and (if time permits) even a game plan to activate it.</description>

                <description>The GDPR is a complicated piece of legislation that impacts everyone that stores or processes personal data. The regulation and its predecessor directive 95/46/EC have been around since 1995 but we are still running into fundamental questions all the time. Because of the complexity of the law and the many many ways in which we all deal with data, it is often not clear if and how the law applies, and if certain technical and procedural measures are adequate to comply with the law. Consequently, we read a lot of misinformation about the GDPR. Even law firms often don't get this right. This workshop will be an in-depth introduction into the GDPR and will explain the basics of GDPR compliance in terms that hackers can understand.</description>

                <description>Instructor @DoodleMe, @KnottyLola, and team will take you through some more of the concepts of Japanese rope bondage (Shibari). You'll build on the theory and knots covered in the first class.

This peer based workshop is aimed at those with some experience or who attended the 101 class. It is not necessary to have attended the 101 class, but we will be moving at a fast pace over what we already covered.

Singles, pairs and groups are welcome. Spots are limited based on the size of the workshop space. First come first serve. No dress code, but it's suggested you avoid loose clothing as this makes it harder to tie. 

Please bring your own (non-stretchy) rope if you have it. A bring a blanket or something else comfy to sit on the floor without shoes is useful too. Workshop will be taught in English.

The workshop is entirely "lab mode" and there is no sexual content, but it remains for over 18's only.</description>

                <description>In this workshop, participants will assemble a small LED sculpture using BlinkyTiles (https://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytile). Each participant will get a kit of 14 tiles. During the workshop, we will explain how the BlinkyTiles work, give a quick lesson in soldering, and assist with assembling your BlinkyTike kit. After the assembly is finished, we will show how you can customize the animations with a simple drawing program.

This workshop is suitable for beginners, and no prior experience with soldering or electronics is required. To join the workshop, participants will need to purchase a BlinkyTile kit on site.

Workshop fee: €35 for the BlinkyTile kit, including  14 tiles, an Arduino compatible controller, and a USB cable.</description>

                <description>**Learn to solder** by making a way-cool, powerful music synthesizer, and  
**learn how to make cool music, sound, (and noise!) with computer chips**  
(The fancy word for making sound with a computer chip is _Digital Signal Processing_ or _DSP_).  
  
[ArduTouch](https://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php#ardutouch) is an open hardware **Ardu**ino-compatible music synthesizer kit with a built-in **Touch** Keyboard, and with built-in speaker/amplifier. It is a really nice performing musical instrument.  
  
This workshop is for **total newbies** to learn to solder.
This workshop is for **total newbies** to make their own ArduTouch music synthesizer and learn to make music, sound (and noise!) with computer chips. Attendees take their completed synthesiser home at the end of the workshop.  
  
The ArduTouch comes pre-programmed with a way cool synthesizer. And I will show you how to re-program it with other way cool (and totally different) synthesizers, as well as how to make your own synthesizers.  
  
For ages 10 - 100.  
  
**Workshop Itinerary:**  
* Intro to music synthesis  
* Basics of making sound with computer chips (Digital Signal Processing)  
* Basics of using an Arduino  
* Learn to solder. Don't let this scare you! I've taught tens of thousands of people to solder, most of whom have never made anything before in their lives. It is actually a very easy skill to learn. It is also very useful.  
* How to re-program your ArduTouch music synthesizer to make lots of cool music, sounds, (and noise!)  
  
**Materials costs**  
The workshop is free, but if you would like to partake in the hands-on aspects of the workshop, Mitch will have ArduTouch kits for **€35**.  
_Optional:_ USB-Serial Cable for re-programming ArduTouch (and many other projects): 5 €.  
  
_**Optional**: Bring your laptop if you want to go home with the free Arduino software installed on it._  
_Arduino software runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux._</description>

                <description>We will do one coler designs and why-Logos in vinyl from svg. You can choose ready to use designs or create your own ones, preferrably with Inkscape. 
Or you can draw a full color picture on paper. We will scan it and transfer it on a shirt. 
Bring your own shirt or bag (any color cotton for vinyl, white and at least 75% polyester for full color). We will probably have a few spare ones, too.

                <abstract>Synthercise is a beginner-friendly dance fitness class set to 8-bit music! Soundtrack is heavy on the 90s bangers and classic demoscene covers. 

If you've never tried dance fitness, it's a workout you don't notice you're doing. You don't have to think of yourself as fit, or a dancer, to enjoy doing it. Wear loose comfortable clothing, trainers, and stay hydrated :)</abstract>

                <abstract>Artist and His Sustainable Pyro-Musical Orchestra

Since the days of the cavemen, fire and lightning have fascinated humanity as top entertainment. Now, Deventer-based artist Uwe Dobberstein harnesses these primal forces to create musical symphonies. His mind-blowing live shows feature crackling Tesla coils, towering flames, and explosive bursts—all coming together in harmonies and rhythmic patterns. Symphony of Fire tames nature itself.</abstract>

                <description>Much like techno trailblazers Kraftwerk, Dobberstein works tirelessly in his own laboratory, continuously inventing new instruments and music. The result in Deventer: a fully computer-controlled mega-orchestra of fire machines! Drawing inspiration from chiptune, rock, classical music, and hip-hop, the outcome is truly spectacular and unlike anything else.

Their pioneering work is gaining attention. The Dutch NOS news has already featured them. Renowned artists like Binkbeats and Def P have collaborated with the team. They’ve even organized their own festival—"De Langste Nacht"—and have been invited to close major events like Burning Man and Dutch Design Week. The future is here!

South African-born Uwe Dobberstein is responsible for design, the nature-driven processes, and literally drives the orchestra with a whip during live shows. Electronic wizard Peter de Man has laid the electronic foundation making these shows technically and musically possible. Peter remarks, “The language of Symphony of Fire is universal, giving audiences something they've never seen, felt, or heard before.”</description>

Making the grid smart is part of the solution, but present its owns set of challenges, because by controlling and manipulating a lot of small consumers or producers at the same time, an attacker can still have a large effect on the grid.
DIVD currently has a research project (https://www.divd.nl/energie/) devoted to this and Hamza and Alexandros are researchers in this project.
In this talk they will show you how they attack smart energy systems using a Honeywell Smart Thermostat as an example device.
After the presentation the presenters will stick around the D42D area/cluster where there will be plenty of devices for you to try and hack and maybe even earn your own CVE.</description>

In this workshop, sponsored by DIVD, you will be building your own Mashtastic pager with decent components that, unlike some devices from certain dubious sources from certain countries, will not explode (we hope, but won't guarantee).
 
All parts will be available in limited supply in the tent at a pay what you want/can policy, if there are any proceeds they will go to DIVD.
Please bring your own laptop if you can to flash and configure the device.</description>

                <abstract>De VPRO bewaarde krantenknipsels over hacken, hackers en computercriminaliteit en die heb ik uit de prullenbak kunnen redden. Titels als "Veel te veel hitsige nerds of What the Hack", "De eigentijdse misdadiger gebruikt een beeldscherm" en "Koernikova-computervirus komt uit Sneek" inspireerden me om deze "Hacker nostalgie" te geven die toeschouwers gegarandeerd "oud" of "jong" zal laten voelen.</abstract>

                <description>By: Frank Breedijk

I started my career in security by subscribing to HackTic and trying and reading stuff, and I even got caught once. The one day my then manager showed up and asked me: "What do you know about firewalls?", and just like that I was responsible for security of a datacenter company.
Since then I worked as a security officer, was the head of a commercial Security Operations Center, a security consultant (for a short time), a security officer and now a CISO and fought DDoS attacks and traced criminals.
Furthermore I've been at DIVD from the start where I founded the csirt, acted as crisis manager, worked on some prominent cases and started "Het Nederlands Security meldpunt" to force our government into action.</description>

                <description>A collection of interactive installations connects art with (complex) science. Theories and model systems from the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics and more are at the base of intriguing images, sounds and texts that you yourself produce. Or is it the other way around?
Caution: The access to the labyrinth is at your own risk. Wear comfortable clothes. High heels are not recommended. Children have to be supervised at all times. Unfortunately the Labyrinth is not accessile to wheelchair users.</description>

This is hands on workshop where your learn how to prepare Korean [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi 김치 (kimchi)]. You will do at least two types of kimchies based on wild/spontaneous fermentation. We will see what type of nice vegetables we will get. Highly likely we will do cabbage kimchi (배추 김치) and then either radish, topinambur or turnip kimchi.

The preparation of vegetable ferments in Korea, called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi “kimchies”], is an ancient fermentation skill based on spontaneous fermentation (naturally occurring lactic acid producing bacteria among the others) and variety of ingredients added. This workshop is a hands-on experience that reviews the basics of Korean kimchi making and today's preparation styles. We will go through the main topics which are salt to vegetables and liquid ratio and when to apply it and how. This one is crucial. We will explain the importance of the effect of ginger, garlic and spicy pepper and their roles in preventing unwanted microbial development. Part of this workshop is tasting of kimchi samples so you get idea what should your results taste like. You will be leaving with jar of kimchi and knowledge how to make your own.

This workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.</description>

This event is dedicated to cider, cidre, sidra or how ever you would like to call beverage prepared by fermentation of apple juice. This event is run by František [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvasírna Jara] project which is a commercial one. 

'''Aims&amp;Selection'''
The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more "complex" "natural ciders" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poirés (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poiré which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.

'''Style'''
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid "commercialization" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace.

This tasting event is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.

                <description>Join us for a practical, hands-on workshop focused on threat modeling in the healthcare space — specifically targeting open-source medical devices like the Android Artificial Pancreas System (AAPS) and OpenAPS. Whether you're a hacker, healthcare professional, or security researcher, this session will boost your ability to think critically about medical device risks from both engineering and cybersecurity perspectives.

We'll explore a blended approach using tools like Attack Trees, INCLUDESNODIRT and STRIDE uncover potential failure points, attack surfaces, and security weaknesses in real-world scenarios. Participants will work together to collaboratively model threats, identify risks, and (if time allows) see if mitigations exist today. The insights generated will be shared back with the OpenAPS community to help improve real-world patient safety.
No prior threat modeling experience is required — just bring your curiosity and a willingness to tinker with one of the most fascinating intersections of healthcare and cybersecurity. By the end, you’ll walk away with new skills, a structured threat modeling mindset, and a deeper appreciation of why cybersecurity in healthcare truly matters.</description>

(Hack your bag)..actually more a makers thing but still fun to do ;-)

== Heat Transfer Vinyl Cutting &amp; Arts &amp; Crafts ==
I'm bringing my small transfer press and vinyl cutter (a Brother Scan 'N Cut, not something self-built unfortunately...) and several little bags (made from an assortment of upcycled coloured fabrics) to decorate.

* '''Please note:''' All materials (Heat transfer vinyl, bags, fabric, etc.) come from my personal stash, a small donation to help cover material costs is very much appreciated - just leave whatever feels fair to you!
* '''Concerning kids:''' Kids are welcome! But '''only''' with parents or adult supervision. Any unattended 'free-range' children will be politely redirected back to their designated adult faster than you can say "where did I put that child?". ;-)


If you're interested, drop by '''Pancake village'''! You're welcome to create or bring a design and decorate your shirt, bag, or whatever you want. 

If you'd like to use my equipment, I do ask that you:
* Respect the WHY2025 code of conduct "Be excellent to each other!" and be mindful about your designs: [[Code_of_Conduct]]
* Decorate at your own risk - once pressed, you '''cannot remove''' the vinyl and might have to live with imperfections. But hey, you've made something custom and unique! ;-)
* Be very careful with the transfer press - it gets '''HOT!''' (130-160°C). Kids cannot use the press without supervision!
* Only press cotton, polyester/cotton blends or nylon items! Other fabrics generally don't play nice with the heat and could melt or won't work with the vinyl I'm bringing. When in doubt, ask me to check the fabric label first so we can adjust the temperature accordingly.

=== Practical info ===
* I'll be around most of the time, but if you don't see me, ask around Pancake village for '''Distels''' or poke me on IRC
* I'll bring small bags (for dice, card decks, or small knick-knacks) and fabric that you can decorate and, if you like, hand-sew into something. Or you can bring your own items to decorate. 
* As long the items are 100% cotton, a polyester/cotton blend, polyester or nylon, it'll work with the vinyl I'm bringing.
* You can bring your own design files in SVG, PNG or JPG format, GIMP works fine for this, and we can try to convert those to .fcm with varying success. 
* Simple designs in SVG or PNG with thick lines and black/white work best. Unfortunately .FCM is Brother proprietary and my plotter works only with these files
* Please please please... don't hack (or break) my setup. I will probably keep everything offline but USB sticks can do damage too ;-)
* Your design needs to be mirrored, especially if you're using text. Unless you like it backwards ;-)
* I will '''try''' to provide a laptop or pc on which to convert designs from .PNG/.SVG to .FCM or to make small adjustments before cutting

=== Other stuff I'm probably bringing ===
* Assorted yarn, crochet/knitting needles and other fiberart related stuff
* Random craft supplies (paper, glue, scissors, colored pencils, etc.)
* Hand-sewing supplies 

=== Tips if you want to decorate a shirt  ===
* I'm not bringing any blanco shirts since I cannot predict your size and don't have a stock, but you can get some at the local shops: Zeeman, Action and HEMA have, not too expensive, T-shirts and aren't too far from our campsite (check [[Facilities]]).

Beer Exchange at Our Village – Share What You Love!

At the Camp, people from all over the world come together — and many of us share a passion for great beer.
Local brews often reflect the character of a place, but some are so small-scale you’ll never find them online or in shops.

That’s why we’re hosting a beer exchange in our village!

Bring a few special beers from your hometown — the quirky, the rare, the traditional — and swap them with fellow enthusiasts.
Let’s share stories, flavors, and maybe even organize a casual tasting session together.

This is your chance to discover beers you'd never find outside your region — unless you're here, at this Camp.

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

                <abstract>This talk is based on my experience working for Comcast/Sky Group in WLAN (802.11) standardisation. It follows the trajectory from environmental laws through to technical regulations and finally in to technical standards, patents and technologies. The talk argues that well-enforced norms and regulations remain a good way of incentivising socially and globally desirable outcomes, while explaining how technical regulations and standardisation work in practice from the industry insider perspective.</abstract>

                <description>A version of this presentation was previously given at the SICT Summer School at ULB in Brussels. It will also be presented at Bornhack and BalcCon in 2025.

I feel like such a talk is especially important now that Europe is no longer under an American security umberella. Europe consistently fails in pushing a rules-based world order, while, in fact, it is difficult to see any other form of world order work either for Europe or indeed the vast majority of countries. We have many parallel examples from privacy, security and data protection law where Europe, again, fails to understand and identify its own critical interests.</description>

                <abstract>As tinker and software geek robotics is a brilliant field. Finally a field that combines the beautiful creations coming out of your FDM printer and the results of multiple cups of coffee turned into (almost) working software. However where do you get started and how does it actually work? This talk is about all these questions and the corresponding answers that I found during my journey to build my first hexapod robot. From designs to simulation, custom pcbs to finally a walking robot.</abstract>

                <description>I'm by no means a roboticist, I'm just an average tinker with a 3d printer and an IDE. This is about my journey to build a hexapod and everything I encountered along the way. From mechanical design and custom PCBs to math and software simulation I'll take you along for the ride. And hopefully help you along on your journey. If you want to get some insight in the inner workings of a hexapod robot, not afraid of some math equations and interested in gazebo simulators this is a good place to be.</description>

                <abstract>AI is everywhere and where it isn't today, it most likely will be tomorrow. But jumping on the hype train and adding AI often does not sufficiently consider security. This talk walks you through cases of AI failures, how they've come about, and how they could have been avoided. We're also going over some projections of spectacular AI failures we're likely to see going forward.</abstract>

                <description>AI is everywhere and where it isn't today, it most likely will be tomorrow. But hype does not sufficiently consider security and AI has the ability to cause errors and failures the developers haven't considered. As was stated in the first Jurassic Park "they were so busy thinking if they could, they didn't stop to think if they should". So we're seeing more examples of failures than are needed for this talk that walks you through a few cases of AI failures, how they've come about, and how they could have been avoided. We're also going over some projections of what we're most likely going to see when you combine AI alignment issues, ability of AI agents to take action, and over confidence of developers in focusing if they could.</description>

                <description>The European electricity network has become a ‘smart grid.’ This offers many opportunities for sustainability but also makes our energy system more vulnerable to digital attacks. In a time of increasing threat of hybrid warfare, the government and the energy sector realize that we as a society must prepare for possible disruption of the energy system and do everything we can to prevent it.

Various institutions test smart devices, set safety standards, and monitor compliance with these standards. However, parties such as our grid operators only have control over the energy grid equipment up to the front door. They are not allowed to look beyond the electricity meter, where most smart equipment is located. DIVD is allowed to do this because we are volunteers and a nonprofit. By identifying devices that can form a botnet, DIVD helps to make the smart grid more secure.

DIVD has been conducting research into vulnerabilities in equipment of the energy system, such as charging stations, solar panel inverters, home batteries, and (Home) Energy Management Systems. Previous findings have led to several parliamentary questions and follow-up actions by authorities such as RDI, the Dutch Authority on Digital Infrastructure. 

With the CVD in the Energy Sector program, DIVD conducts research at its own hardware hacking lab in collaboration with the energy sector to reduce the digital vulnerability of our energy system. We also organise hack events. During WHY2025 we also give demos at the Vulnerability Disclosure Village. 

In this talk, we will demonstrate how we could have generated power outages using zero-days we found in solar converters, electric car chargers and energy management systems. Still, we also did it with just one user-password combination…</description>

                <description>With his unique background in electronics and digital innovation, Dries has become a voice for forward-thinking brands and marketing professionals looking to navigate today's complex digital landscape. His artistic approach can directly inspire brands to think differently and develop original marketing concepts that stand out. Through his work, Dries demonstrates how combining creativity with technological insight creates viral moments.

His award-winning "Die With Me" app, accessible only when a user's phone battery drops below 5%, demonstrates how scarcity and unique user experiences can create powerful engagement. On Black Friday, he doubles the price of his app instead of offering discounts, showing brands how breaking marketing rules can create attention. 

In his viral project "The Follower," Dries leverages open cameras and AI to reveal the reality behind curated Instagram moments—offering marketers an unfiltered look at consumer behavior and content creation.

Meanwhile, "The Flemish Scrollers" uses AI to automatically identify politicians using smartphones during parliamentary sessions, highlighting how technology can create accountability and transparency in public spaces.

Dries has exhibited at prestigious venues including the Barbican in London, Art Basel, Mutek Festival in Montreal,ZKM, Bozar, WIRED and Ars Electronica.

As a speaker, he's shared insights with innovative organizations including TEDx, MoMA, SXSW, Chanel, Adidas, Samsung, Deloitte, KBC and Adobe.</description>

                <abstract>It started with a simple idea in 2016: make the state of security of our government transparent/public. The simple idea has become national government policy. Using transparency we've helped fix tons of security issues, reduce costs and increased control on IT. This year we've rolled out in Belgium and started measuring accessibility of websites in the same fashion. Learn how we've achieved extreme impact with a minimal budget and keep on doing so. Security and accessibility must be commodities.</abstract>

                <description>(We're planning a couple of nice surprises during this talk exclusive for WHY2025. As always: it will make some people nervous, yet it will make society better.)

A transparent and accountable society creates trust. We're currently monitoring all important organizations in the Netherlands on about 25 security, privacy and sovereignty metrics. You can see openly where organizations are doing great or where they are even (unknowingly) breaking the law.

With the EU requiring accessibility on multiple sectors this year, we've also starting measuring accessibility in the same fashion. You can clearly distinguish organizations with and without an accessibility policy.

We'll show what it looks like, the impact it has, the awesome cyber tokens and certificates we make and the sets of open data we create.

The project is at its peak right now. If you want to make an impact on society: this is where it's at.</description>

                <abstract>Love reverse engineering? You'd be right since you always find something interesting! In this talk we're going to study absolutely every byte of the DNA source of a real bacterium. And in doing so, we'll find bootstrapping code, genes, duplicate genes, anti-viral defense mechanisms, idiomatic/non-idiomatic/borrowed code &amp; much more. It helps if you've also visited the companion talk on DNA, but this presentation is broadly accessible even without prior knowledge.</abstract>

                <description>A typical bacterium has around one megabyte of DNA as its source code. And with our digital reverse engineering hat on, it turns out we can analyse this code and quickly learn things. Where do genes begin and end? What is the stuff between genes? How do bacteria bootstrap themselves? And, where do microbes store their immune system? Using digital skills, all this can be found just by looking at the DNA letters. And that is what we'll be doing in this talk.</description>

                <description>As electric vehicles become increasingly integrated into our transportation infrastructure, the security of their charging systems is becoming paramount. A threat actor hacking EV chargers at scale could have a real life impact on the continuity of our power grid and the transportation sector. Therefore, it is important that manufacturers and operators are well aware of their role in protecting our power grid.

During this talk we'll discuss the details on how we extracted the firmware, the vulnerabilities we found and the story of one drunk night of hacking till 07:00 AM in Tokyo that resulted in some much more high-impact vulnerabilities than were needed for the competition...</description>

                <description>This talk will cover typical pitfalls you encounter if you try to host your own mailserver solution: Often, those issues are only noticed by users not being able to sent emails successfully - let's go ahead and learn about those beforehand.
Starting off with the basics of secure mail transmission using (START)SSL on top of SMTP and advancing into DKIM, SPF for secured mailserver origins. Then mentioning a few nice-to-have tools for delivery monitoring like DMARC and Postmark. Then being careful with DNS configuration and RFC-restrictions quickly overlooked.
Furthermore, let's take a look into TLSA for SMTP, BIMI or complex setups with satellite delivery systems.
Finally, let's discuss user-based security with locked-down IMAP, PGP signatures and encryption or enforcing secure connections.</description>

                <abstract>Smart devices are deeply embedded in the physical world: they can see, hear, and control things around us, often with zero real limits. When they’re hacked, it’s not just your data on the line; it’s your safety, privacy, and environment. In this talk, I’ll share some new ideas for putting a layer of access control between these devices and the real world, so we stop giving them a blank check.</abstract>

                <description>These days, “smart” devices aren’t just watching and listening: they can act on the physical world, often with zero meaningful limits. They unlock doors, adjust thermostats, steer vacuums, and record what’s going on around us 24/7. When these devices get compromised, and many do, it’s not just boring data on the line. It’s your safety, privacy, and physical space.

The problem? We’ve handed out root access to the physical world like candy. Any device can sense or actuate whenever it wants. There's no layered control, no boundaries between software and the real world. If malware gets in, it gets full access to your home, office, or anything else the device is wired into.

In this talk, I’ll show how we can fix that by treating _sensing and actuation as privileges_,not defaults. Instead of giving every device free rein over what it can hear or control, we can build mechanisms that require software to explicitly request, and be granted, access to the physical world. That access can be temporary, conditional, or denied altogether.

We'll look at how to physically separate sensors and actuators from the software stack so that even if a device is compromised, it can’t automatically reach into your environment. We'll also explore approaches that enforce forgetfulness: ensuring that standby devices like smart speakers can’t quietly hoard data or leak it when compromised. If nothing relevant to the device's task happened, nothing should be remembered.

The goal is simple: to take back control from black-box devices and start designing systems where physical-world access isn’t assumed, it’s earned.</description>

                <abstract>The WHY2025 Capture the Flag competition (CTF) has multiple lockpicking challenges as part of the CTF. Successfully picking these locks gives you one of the flags. To be able to create a solid CTF challenge out of an ordinary lock we had to come up with some kind of solution. We used our past experiences in CTFs as inspiration to see how we could do it better. This talk shows the concepts we came up with and which are currently used in the WHY2025 CTF.</abstract>

                <abstract>Experimental archeology to understand the development of woodwind instruments. What I learned about woodwind instruments by using a spoon drill to make a bore and a whip lathe to reinvent medieval woodturning.

I will discuss cylindrical and conical bores, why they are different in a musical sense and why the technology of the times favours one over the other.

I will also link some peculiar instruments to the medieval education system of the guilds.</abstract>

                <description>The famous leather archeologist Olaf Goubitz once said "You can only understand a historical shoe after you have made it".

After following a hobby course in instrument building and a year working as a medieval woodworker in the historical theme park Archeon, I wanted to go back to the roots and build instruments with the tools of the time.

I basically want to become a medieval instrument builder's apprentice, even tough all masters are gone for centuries. With this talk I want to share what I have learned so far.</description>

                <abstract>From (political) climate change to people marrying AI chatbots. The world can be a scary place. 

This talk will be a comprehensive guide to anxiety. We’ll go through the basics of neuroscience and **causes of anxiety**, look at **the effects of the neurodivergent brain on anxiety** and you will be provided with **tools backed by science to implement directly into your daily life!**</abstract>

                <description>You might feel tension in your chest when preparing a presentation, or a funny feeling in your stomach when you know you'll have to take public transport. Almost everyone feels anxious every once in a while, and about 15% of adults in the Netherlands have or have had an anxiety disorder. An explanation about what causes these feelings, and good applicable solutions on managing these feelings are sadly not always easy to find. 

This talk will first provide you with a basic understanding of the (neuro)science behind anxiety. After we have a clear picture of **the causes of anxiety** we’ll look at neurodivergent brains, as many of us are blessed with one of those, and how that can influence anxiety. Last, but definitely not least, we’ll look at current research on anxiety interventions. And I'll provide you with **practical tips**, applicable **long term changes** that might help with daily well-being and **what to do when stressing about the existence of blockchains!**

(Ps. don’t worry, I won't tell you to just go for a run)</description>

                <abstract>I briefly explain quantum cryptography. It is unbreakable in principle, but its real implementations have vulnerabilities arising from equipment imperfections. Certification standards [1] and accredited labs are being
established that can test commercial products for these flaws. I explain how we have analysed a commercial quantum key distribution system for loopholes, patched them, and designed tests for the certification lab [2].</abstract>

                <description>Tijdens WHY2025 organiseren we Het Grote Cyber Debat waar politici het gesprek aangaan met de mensen die dagelijks aan de knoppen zitten: ethische hackers, open source-ontwikkelaars, securityprofessionals en AI-tinkerers. Scherpe vragen en eerlijke antwoorden, van en voor een publiek dat weet waar het over gaat.

Onlangs presenteerde het huidige kabinet de vernieuwde Nederlandse Digitaliseringsstrategie. Maar de toekomst? Die wordt straks geschreven in partijprogramma’s. Daarom nodigen we juist nu Kamerleden, bestuurders en beleidsmakers uit om te luisteren, te leren en te debatteren met de tech-community vóór de verkiezingskoorts losbarst.

Vier politieke partijen hebben zich al gemeld. Zij gaan, onder toeziend oog van de bezoekers van WHY2025, met elkaar in debat over cyberveiligheid, privacy en andere digitale thema’s die onze community belangrijk vindt. De eerste namen houden we nog even spannend, maar… er is nog ruimte voor meer! 

Ben of ken je kamerleden, bestuurders, verkiezingsprogrammaschrijvers en/of digitale beleidsmakers die hier aan mee willen doen? Stuur dan een mail naar: content@why2025.org</description>

                <description>This talk covers how and why I developed the Flipper Blackhat: starting at the hardware level through the bootloader, kernel and up to user space. On the hardware side, I'll detail the power supplies, the DDR3 routing, radios, and the A33 processor itself. I'll show the build system, device trees, Python scripts and the penetesting suite I ship with it.

I'll provide an overview of the exploits I've written for it and how to control them from the Flipper app. I will also do a live demo of the device in honeypot mode, RAT driving, AP scanning, embedded exploit etc...</description>

                <description>Since the internet exists, people have been trying to circumvent security. Whereas most people nowadays do so for financial gain, 35+ years ago the world looked different. The internet connected academia. The people hacking were students, almost the only people who had access. Not many system administrators were paying much attention to security and for hackers, breaking into sites such as that of NASA, were ways to gain a reputation. In this presentation, "one of the Dutch hackers" will take a look at the hacking scene in the late 1980s, early 1990s.</description>

                <abstract>Passkeys are a new way to log in without passwords. They solve a lot of the traditional security risks associated with passwords. But passkeys are only secure if implemented well. When implemented incorrectly, they lead to new attack vectors that hackers can exploit.</abstract>

                <description>In this talk, we will first study the protocol behind passkeys, called Webauthn. We will then look at some common implementation mistakes, and how we can exploit them. Next, we will present a methodology to carry out pentests on Webauthn implementations, and finally we discuss some vulnerabilities that we detected (and disclosed!) in various web applications.

This talk is based on joint research with Peizhou Chen (University of Twente).</description>

                <description>Security-minded people have been raising awareness, setting up processes, creating standards and protocols, finding, fixing and exploiting vulnerabilities for years, cybersecurity industry has hundreds of vendors solving all kinds of security problems, and yet there are more risks uncovered and more breaches happening.
This session will be a safe space to talk about annoying issues not fixed in security, pick what you think is wrong with cybersecurity and tell us. We'll start with our most painful cybersecurity griefs, and we want audience to participate in this collective rant, and let it all out. Let's see what the attendees think in the end of the rant - are we all doomed, or is there light at the end of the tunnel.</description>

                <description>Zero Trust (ZT) is a security paradigm gaining traction, especially in the US defense community. The underlying idea is to reduce implicit trust as much as possible. This makes great sense from a security perspective. 
Its implementation is daunting though, because it is not about dropping a new product in the security landscape. Instead, it is more an approach and a process. It is still hard to prioritize ZT and to retrofit it to existing system architectures.
In the talk I will show how ZT is the progression of many security ideas that you may already be familiar with, and how you can rebrand and review what you are already doing to show that you are making progress.

Outline:
As a contributor to the Cloud Security Alliances Zero Trust cert (CCZT), and experienced instructor, I intend to borrow from the (public) body of knowledge and my experiences in teaching that.
This will give the audience a good insight in Zero Trust content and trends.

This will include
- the core idea (never trust, always verify)
- the major use cases
- business value of ZT
- steps in implementing
- publicly available maturity models
- example implementations and status thereof (e.g. US Airforce)
- link to earlier principles
- retrofitting ZT on an existing application
- experiences</description>

                <abstract>Economic models are increasingly challenged for destroying our planet.  But it is not easy to design a sustainable alternative.  In a follow-up on my OHM talk "hacking for bankers", I would like to present a few realistic currencies that we can use to move away from the unsustainable path that we are currently walking.  We could build a profitable yet sustainable grassroots movement.</abstract>

                <description>At OHM2013 I gave a talk entitled _Hacking for Bankers_ where I explained the perverse motives in the present monetary system.  This talk presents solutions.  They are grassroots systems, that redefine money by choosing another basis for it.  A humane basis.

  * **Sensible Bullion.**  Founded on precious metals such as gold and silver, stored safely in a vault, with (title of) ownership claimable by the one who presents the corresponding digital coins.  While the coins exist, they can circulate for online trading.  Great for long-term savings, neutral for spending, but difficult to handle for investors.

  * **Sensible Energy.** Trading in sustainable energy at zero cost at a parallel energy market.  In the Netherlands, we have rolled out so much sustainable energy that the energy market is giving a push-back instead of handling it with storage systems.  Bypassing this market allows at least wind and solar energy to give each other mutual support, expressing that these are dependent elements in our country's sustainable future, and that they need to evolve together.

  * **Sensible Focus.** Economic theory teaches us that human attention is the most valuable asset overall.  But since money expresses something else, it makes _business sense_ to optimise humans (and humanity) out of products and services.  Were money to express the actual focus of a human being, then the world would be a different place.

  * **Sensible Dinosaur.** What if we put a (monetary) value on unexcavated fossil fuels?  Would we then be able to resist digging it up and burning it?  If we created such a money, could it pay for climate debt?  Perhaps to correct the inequalities caused by climate change?  Or maybe to pay for CO₂ recovery measures?

Essential to all these currencies are a few guiding principles, with details in the [Book of Sensible Taler](http://book.sensible-taler.org/):

 1. Currencies must be **fully backed** by an underlying value; this leaves no room for inflation
 2. The underlying value cannot be borrowed, so **no interest** can be charged.  Deep **participation with profit-sharing** offers a substitute investment mechanism.
 3. Digital money entitles the owner to **claim the underlying value**.  Payment systems must have **legal structures** to maintain this property even after bankruptcy.
 4. Expenses are out in the open, there ore **no concealed fees** or indirect costs.

Different underlying rules about the workings of money triggers people to make different choices.  This is how these monetary system designs can focus on sustainability, rather than mindlessly chasing short-term profit.  Such a system can co-exist with the fiat money issued by governments.  And the digital money form is founded on [GNU Taler](https://www.taler.net/en/), it is fit for secure and private online payment at least as easily as fiat money.

                <description>The Open Source Imaging Initiative has developed an open-source low-field MRI – and is now working on the clinical certification for it (+will open-source it as far as legally possible)!
This started raising some discussions around the costs and patenting-schemes in public healthcare. But what about the rest of the public infrastructure? And who keeps control of what?

This talk will give an overview of the current state of the project, a bit of historic context (how could this happen??) and will explore the current discussions around governance and property models – and the idea of Open-Source Standard Hardware</description>

                <abstract>Birdsong is all around us, but is there a deeper meaning? Can computer analysis help us decipher these hidden patterns in our own backyards? This talk charts my journey exploring the world of open source projects for bird (and bat!) audio identification, some of the systems I've operated, and the data art pieces I've created from the results. From the science of migration, to machine learning models and data visualization, to bioethics, there's something for every hacker to be inspired by.</abstract>

                <description>Getting started with a new microcontroller can be daunting. They do come with datasheets, but these are often hundreds if not thousands of pages long and assume you already know the basics. So that's what I will be explaining: how to get started programming these thing, from `Reset_Handler` to blinking LED.

This talk will cover the following things: 

* How to read datasheets
* How to write a simple linker script
* How to do basic initialization of a chip, enough to get a LED blinking
* How to get the binary you created onto a microcontroller.

I will assume you have some programming experience, but experience with embedded software is not required.</description>

                <description>After the [Air France-KLM dataleak](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-lightningtalks-58027-air-france-klm-6-char-short-code) I kept repeating this was not a real hack, and confessed I always wanted to hack a system based on triggering race conditions because the lack of proper transactions.
This was way easier than expected. In this talk I will show how just adding `$ seq 0 9 | xargs -I@ -P10 ..` can break some systems, and how to write safe database transactions that prevent abuse.

In this talk I will explain what race conditions are. Many examples of how and why code will fail. How to properly create a database transaction. The result of abusing this in real life (e.g. free parking).</description>

But how do they work? In this talk, I'll share my experience building a randomizer for the Gameboy Advance version of Final Fantasy 1. I'll tell you about the stumbling blocks I hit, and how I solved them. I'll also share the lessons I learned building my project, and how I'd do it better next time.</description>

                <abstract>A Domain-Specific Language is a computer language that’s made and suitable for a specific domain — *dûh*. But what happens when that domains is inhabited and operated by people that are – **gasp**! – not developers?! This is when a DSL has the opportunity to shine, and even outshine generic AI.</abstract>

                <description>The field of Domain-Specific Languages has been going through a quasi-perpetual, reincarnating Gartner hype cycle for decades. Nevertheless, there are many DSLs out there, with many aimed squarely at software devs, and some at non-devs.

In this talk, I’ll explain what a DSL is and is made up of, and why you‘d want to make one – especially for non-devs! –, why and how to do that using something called “projectional editing”, why and how DSLs are better than AI, and why DSLs should be a standard tool in our dev-toolbox.</description>

                <description>When Martine Postma organized her first Repair-Café in Amsterdam, would she have imagined the kind of traction that her initiative would gain worldwide? With rampant enshittification of services, but also products ("planned obsolescence") comes resistance from consumers and politics. I'll show a few blatant examples and outline the recent progress in EU legislation.</description>

                <abstract>FreeSewing is the leading open-source library for parametric sewing patterns and combines sewing patterns with code; instead of drafting patterns on paper (hardly an easy task!), you can now enter the measurements of your body into the platform to get a sewing pattern that fits YOU. In this talk, I will introduce you to FreeSewing, the sewing world as a whole and FreeSewing's role in it, and I will show a peek under the hood of a FreeSewing pattern.</abstract>

                <description>If you want to learn how to sew, you must first have a sewing pattern. You are left to either buy (or find) sewing patterns, which are commonly graded (resized) up and down (often based on some "ideal" body shape, which does not take variations into account well), or you have to learn a whole new skill of pattern drafting. Although that skill has become more accessible through the internet, it is still difficult to learn the more complex you go.

With FreeSewing, sewing patterns are parametric: they adapt to the measurements you put in, which is a lot more comprehensive than the grading-up-and-down system, and more inclusive of "different" body types too. (We don't believe in an "average body type".) Plus, it's available for free to anyone with access to an internet browser. FreeSewing also includes documentation for both sewing and programming.

FreeSewing is a baby born out of spite, as the founder Joost was (and still is) too tall for what clothing stores have to offer. The talk will not be given by him, but by an enthusiastic contributor (who is too short for what clothing stores have to offer ;)).</description>

                <abstract>Modern UI/UX design is rooted in centuries-old geometry. This talk explores how historic tools—from Greek constructions to Bézier curves— is still broadly used to solve real problems today. Through demos and visual examples, we’ll uncover practical, eye-opening methods that blend math, art, and design. No technical background needed—just curiosity. Prepare to rethink how we build and understand the visual world.</abstract>

                <description>Modern UI/UX design is built upon concepts much older than computers. This talk uncovers how ideas from the history of geometry continue to shape the ways we define and render interfaces today—while also revealing a deeper story: how practical mathematical problems, from antiquity to today, have been approached not with algebra, but with the elegance of geometric construction.

We’ll explore geometric throughlines, from Greek straightedge-and-compass methods, through innovations of the Islamic Golden Age, to Renaissance engineers and their mechanical drawing tools, all the way to Bézier curves of the 1960s—now foundational to every smooth SVG path on the web. Alongside interactive demos and visual examples, we’ll dive into surprisingly current problems that are solved through construction alone, in ways that are both rigorous and astonishingly intuitive.

This talk is for anyone with a curious mind—no technical background required. While code snippets will appear, the real goal is to spark insight and wonder. Join us to discover how a blend of math, history, and art can transform the way we see both digital and physical space—and how centuries-old ideas continue to solve problems in ways that are as beautiful as they are practical.</description>

                <description>After three years of research, in 2022 the first version of PLOT4AI launched with 86 AI-related threats. At that time AI security was still a niche topic discussed mainly by a few and AI safety was barely recognized beyond robotics and reinforcement learning. 
Then, just seven months later, ChatGPT launched, and the AI landscape changed overnight.
Suddenly, AI became a central topic in public discourse, governance, and policy. The EU AI Act entered the scene, putting fundamental rights at the heart of AI product regulation. What was once a niche technical concern had become a global geopolitical issue, influencing regulatory and economic agendas around the world.

It became clear: PLOT4AI needed a major update.

In this talk, the author of PLOT4AI will take you behind the scenes of the tool’s creation and introduce PLOT4AI 2.0: a major new release of this open source AI threat modeling framework. The updated version includes over 138 AI-related threats, including threats related to Generative AI, Agentic AI, and complex deployment environments. 

PLOT4AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a collaborative effort to make AI safer for everyone! As an open source initiative, it's built on feedback, shared experience, and contributions. Whether you’ve spotted a missing threat, devised a new mitigation, or have real-world examples to add, your input is welcome and encouraged!

This talk is both a deep dive into the evolution of AI threat modeling and a call to action for the AI open source communities to shape safer, more accountable AI together.</description>

                <abstract>Challenge the Cyber is a foundation that actively fosters security skills in young hackers (&lt;25 y). In this talk a couple of our (former) participants will share their experience and talk about the varieties of events that the foundation runs throughout the year and how you can prepare and participate. This includes the yearly CTF, a Cyber bootcamp, recurring training events with CTF team Superflat and the participation at the European Cybersecurity Challenge.</abstract>

                <description>There's an overall shortage of cyber security experts. Challenge the Cyber (CTC) is the foundation that actively fosters security skills in young people and works on closing the gap between the need of experts in companies and talented young people who want to become these experts.

CTC run a national hacking competition (CTF) with roughly 120 participants each year. The best (30-40) performers are then invited to a week long bootcamp in the summer in which highly technical workshops are given, a lot of attention is spent on team building and eventually a team of 10 players is selected for the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC). At ECSC team NL is supported again by CTC.

Next to the competition there are side events where anyone can participate, such as playing CTFs with team Superflat. All in all, young people develop and progress through the years to our absolute elite in cyber security. (No, I'm not exaggerating here. We've got zero days as proof :D )

The presentation will tell all that and more but the story will be told with anecdotes by active participants and volunteers of the foundation. They will give an inspiring insight into the world of the young star hackers and their journeys throughout CTC.</description>

                <abstract>To understand the inner workings of Kubernetes and to prepare for the K8s certification exams, I decided to create a K8s cluster from scratch, the hard way, on premises (“de meterkast”) on virtual machines all using Alpine Linux. This talk is how I tried to do it, how I succeeded, failed and added a CEPH cluster and ETCD cluster along the way. It includes a lot of technical details, but if there is one thing that you should learn during this talk, it’s not about K8s at all: Containers are not VM</abstract>

After "Knock knock who's there 1.0" at MCH2022, we will again look at some high-tech lockpicking, this time at more sensitive locations. The responsible disclosure is a tale of it's own! And why exactly is a 3-letter agency in the US interested in the disclosure?</abstract>

                <description>Feeling safe at home and at work is one of the most basic requirements for living. Part of being, and feeling, safe is the physical access system of the building.
Since the last talk at MCH2022 more building entrance systems have been researched. The findings will be presented in this talk. And these findings have led to multiple CVE's and the discovery of single DES encryption and Mifare classic access card systems.
One manufacturer who makes  building entrance systems used at very sensitive objects such as tv studio's and airports managed to leak the private key of a CA they use to manage the building access.
In another case we were able to generate license key files under the name of a very well known person.
In all cases we will look at the vulnerability disclosure and how to make sure you do not end up in prison (although with these locks....)</description>

                <abstract>You’ve released your code under a free license, but your project runs on proprietary platforms like Slack, GitHub, Notion, or Zoom. What’s the harm? In this talk, we’ll explore how relying on closed tools contradicts open source values, excludes contributors, locks your community into corporate ecosystems, and drives away idealistic contributors who care deeply about freedom. We’ll also tackle common justifications, like convenience or popularity, and show how they often mask deeper trade-offs.</abstract>

                <description>My goal with this talk is to spark reflection and conversation about the tools we use to build open source projects, not just the code we write. I hope it encourages both new and experienced maintainers to think critically about how proprietary tools may be limiting their communities and values, even unintentionally. The audience will leave with a better understanding of the trade-offs involved, practical alternatives they can explore, and the motivation to make small changes that lead to more open, inclusive, and resilient projects. If more projects switch to even one open alternative, it strengthens the entire open source ecosystem by reducing dependency on tech giants and supporting community-owned infrastructure. 

Whether you're starting a new project or maintaining a mature one, this talk will challenge you to think critically about the tools you use and advocate for open, community-controlled alternatives that align with the spirit of FOSS.</description>

                <description>In an effort to demystify origins, development, and current role of shells, this talk tells a tale deeply rooted in the earliest days of UNIX development. In the process, several (historic as well as current) shells will be introduced among their notable features and impact on contemporary systems. To finish of, the talk discusses the legacy of historic shells and their influence on modern operating systems with or without UNIX heritage.

While technical in parts, this is first and foremost a historical presentation with a bit of an outlook. Less tech-savvy audience members should thus still be able to enjoy this. In fact, newcomers to the shell may find some useful hints.

                <abstract>Why limit yourself to Ethernet and Wi-Fi when every wire in your house can carry packets? This talk explores alternative physical networking technologies that exist but are often overlooked. From Powerline Networking (HomePlug AV/AV2) to MoCA over coaxial cables, we’ll dive into how these systems work, their encryption and security models, known exploits, and the inherent risks of non-switched cable mediums.</abstract>

                <description>Beyond the theoretical, we’ll examine real-world applications, including whole-home audio and video distribution, network segmentation strategies, and the unexpected advantages of leveraging existing infrastructure. You’ll see how HDMI matrices, IP-based video distribution, and networked audio solutions like SONOS Net can integrate seamlessly over alternative backbones. We’ll cover segmentation techniques to isolate security cameras, IoT devices, and AV distribution, ensuring efficiency and security.

Expect deep technical insights, practical lessons from years of experimentation, and a fresh perspective on what’s possible when you stop thinking of cables as just power or TV lines—and start treating them as network highways. Whether you're looking to expand connectivity in a complex environment or just want to push the limits of home networking, this talk will leave you with new tools, techniques, and ideas to explore.</description>

                <description>A tetrapod is a famous 4-legged geometric shape made of concrete and can be seen protecting coastlines around the world.
In this workshop you will make your own mini plush tetrapod from fabric, wadding and stitches!
No prior experience required, but we'll be using sewing machines and needles and thread, so you should be comfortable handling them.
**Space will be limited - I'll do some form of sign up closer to the day. Watch this space...**
The workshop takes 2 hours, though we may be done quicker than that depending on numbers.</description>

                <description>Perfume often seem like something exclusive. Mysterious ingredients, luxury brands, and secret recipes. But in this workshop, we’ll show you how to hack the world of perfume using simple tools, shared knowledge, and a bit of help from AI.

Smell is one of our most powerful senses. It helps us recognize danger, feel comfort, remember people, and imagine new experiences. In this session, we’ll each create a custom perfume that reflects our personal idea of a better future—whether that’s calm, community, wild nature, or something totally unique.

Here’s what we’ll do:
- Smell and get to know a range of ingredients we provide.
- Use tools like online databases, example recipes and AI we will match ideas and feelings to real scents.
- Mix and test small amounts to build your own perfume.
- Share your scent and the story behind it.

No experience needed. We’ll guide you through the process step by step. You’ll leave with your own small perfume and maybe some new ideas about how smell connects to how we see the world.</description>

                <abstract>You know those people that take a balloon, inflate it and after some twisting, turning, and some squicky noises they end up with a balloon creature?

You could be one!

Because, baloon folding isn't that hard, actually.

I have the balloons, instructions and will actually try to teach during this workshop as well.

Are you an adult and know how to do this, I could sure use some help to survive the chaos ;)

                <abstract>It is well known that humans are the weakest link in information security.
Social engineering has emerged as a means to influence and manipulate individuals to achieve desired outcomes. In this presentation, we delve into the realm of social engineering, exploring the art of behavior alteration, manipulation and persuasive communication.</abstract>

                <description>We will provide a general introduction to social engineering and guide the audience in the very first steps to actually start training this skill in a safe and responsible manner that will allow you to get a taste of social engineering by slightly altering your behaviour and still staying legal.

We will cover the following topics:
- Introduction to social engineering
- Using OSINT to collect initial information
- Creating pretext
- Fundamental principles of human behavior and decision-making
- Leveraging social normativity in persuasive interactions
- Building rapport and trust
- Exploiting trust
- Practical exercises in everyday life</description>

                <abstract>&lt;cite&gt;Knitting Our Internet&lt;/cite&gt; is an **interactive journey** through the history of the Internet, and a **collective rethinking** of its future.

The activity consists of a **face-to-face workshop**, providing tangible and simple examples about how the Internet works, simultaneously **questioning** the very essence of today’s mainstream social networks. Its main purpose is to expose the critical limits of **surveillance capitalism**, **centralization**, and its **environmental impact**.</abstract>

                <description>Using my grandma’s yarn, we’ll simulate a centralized network, clearly and practically exposing the intrinsic limits and issues of any centralized infrastructure.

After pinpointing these problems, we’ll time-travel to the beginnings of the Internet, discovering that decentralization was actually at its heart. We will travel through the history of the Internet and of the Web by reading quotes and observing pictures, together. We’ll see how the problem of social media “enshittification” and the criticalities of big tech do not arise at all from a technical issue, but it is all a social, political, and economical matter.

Therefore, we’ll dive into the concept of “Surveillance Capitalism” unmasking the hidden dynamics of the digital technology industry, from data harvesting to emotional manipulation.

How do we take Our Internet back? How can we make it truly decentralized again? The workshop ends with the simulation of a decentralized network among the participants, still using my grandma’s yarn. We will have uncovered how decentralization is key not only to address social media issues, but it’s a broader political structure we should be using as reference in pursuing brighter and more human perspectives.

                <description>A rope jam is an open, unstructured space for tying, practicing, or learning together. You can come alone, with a partner, or in a small group. Attendees are encouraged to: self tie, seek others to tie with, be tied by, switch with, observe or talk rope with.

We’ll begin with a short intro and help match people up for those who arrive on time. You’re also welcome to bring your own partner(s) or simply observe and chat.

What to bring:

- Non-stretchy rope (if you have it)
- A blanket or cushions for sitting on the floor without shoes
- No dress code, but avoid loose clothing, it makes tying harder

Rules:

 - Consent is mandatory - always ask before engaging
 - This is a non-sexual, fully clothed space (“lab mode”)
 - No photography unless everyone involved agrees
 - Respect people’s boundaries and focus
 - Don’t interrupt active scenes
 - Keep conversation low and rope-focused to match the atmosphere

A small amount of practice rope will be available. 

Whether you're new to rope or experienced, this is a relaxed space to share skills, learn, or just enjoy the vibe. Come say hi!</description>

                <description>LED strips have become really inexpensive. And many people have created easy methods of controlling the color and brightness of individual LEDs in LED strips. This workshop will show you a couple of easy and fun ways to control LED strips, and to make them do what you want. I'll show you everything you need to know to use existing Arduino programs -- and how to hack Arduino programs -- to control the colors in your world with LED strips.  
  
**Workshop Itinerary:**  
* Intro to color theory and Red-Green-Blue _(RGB)_ LEDs  
* Brief intro to Arduino  
* How to use an Arduino to control an LED strip  
* Some demos of programs you can download for free  

**Materials cost:**  
The workshop is free, but if you would like to partake in the hands-on aspects of the workshop, Mitch will have materials for **€20**.  
  
_**Optional:** Bring your laptop if you want to go home with the free Arduino software installed on it._

                <abstract>A kids intro to soldering.
Have you ever seen a weevil? With this very simple soldering kit, we want to celebrate this amazing beetle. The kit is a very easy-to-build kit with through-hole components, specifically aimed at beginners. It has only a few parts, so even small children can easily assemble it. Once assembled, the red LED "eyes" will light up brighter or dimmer depending on how much light falls on the photo sensor.</abstract>

                <description>REYN is a multidisciplinary Dutch artist: An incredible musician who is, above all, a writer of genius, producer, mixing engineer and performer. He started at the age of 16 by writing soundtracks for some of the greatest video-game publishers (Last Ninja III, Flimbo’s Quest). To this day, he has recorded more than a dozen movie soundtracks and theme-tunes for TV-series. Over the last few years, he has also been arranging for Amsterdam Sinfonietta and the Residentie Orkest’s philharmonic orchestra in the Netherlands. He won numerous prizes at the Edisons, the Dutch music awards.

In addition to his classical experience with orchestras, Reyn is also a producer and musical director that has made his mark on both the Dutch and the French pop scene, having worked on albums and tours for artists such as Vanessa Paradis, ZAZ, Benjamin Biolay, Stephan Eicher, Gaëtan Roussel, Teitur, Mister &amp; Mississippi, Wende, Kane, among others.</description>

                <abstract>Artist and His Sustainable Pyro-Musical Orchestra

Since the days of the cavemen, fire and lightning have fascinated humanity as top entertainment. Now, Deventer-based artist Uwe Dobberstein harnesses these primal forces to create musical symphonies. His mind-blowing live shows feature crackling Tesla coils, towering flames, and explosive bursts—all coming together in harmonies and rhythmic patterns. Symphony of Fire tames nature itself.</abstract>

                <description>Much like techno trailblazers Kraftwerk, Dobberstein works tirelessly in his own laboratory, continuously inventing new instruments and music. The result in Deventer: a fully computer-controlled mega-orchestra of fire machines! Drawing inspiration from chiptune, rock, classical music, and hip-hop, the outcome is truly spectacular and unlike anything else.

Their pioneering work is gaining attention. The Dutch NOS news has already featured them. Renowned artists like Binkbeats and Def P have collaborated with the team. They’ve even organized their own festival—"De Langste Nacht"—and have been invited to close major events like Burning Man and Dutch Design Week. The future is here!

South African-born Uwe Dobberstein is responsible for design, the nature-driven processes, and literally drives the orchestra with a whip during live shows. Electronic wizard Peter de Man has laid the electronic foundation making these shows technically and musically possible. Peter remarks, “The language of Symphony of Fire is universal, giving audiences something they've never seen, felt, or heard before.”</description>

Making the grid smart is part of the solution, but present its owns set of challenges, because by controlling and manipulating a lot of small consumers or producers at the same time, an attacker can still have a large effect on the grid.
DIVD currently has a research project (https://www.divd.nl/energie/) devoted to this and Hamza and Alexandros are researchers in this project.
In this talk they will show you how they attack smart energy systems using a Honeywell Smart Thermostat as an example device.
After the presentation the presenters will stick around the D42D area/cluster where there will be plenty of devices for you to try and hack and maybe even earn your own CVE.</description>

In this workshop, sponsored by DIVD, you will be building your own Mashtastic pager with decent components that, unlike some devices from certain dubious sources from certain countries, will not explode (we hope, but won't guarantee).
 
All parts will be available in limited supply in the tent at a pay what you want/can policy, if there are any proceeds they will go to DIVD.
Please bring your own laptop if you can to flash and configure the device.</description>

                <description>A collection of interactive installations connects art with (complex) science. Theories and model systems from the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics and more are at the base of intriguing images, sounds and texts that you yourself produce. Or is it the other way around?
Caution: The access to the labyrinth is at your own risk. Wear comfortable clothes. High heels are not recommended. Children have to be supervised at all times. Unfortunately the Labyrinth is not accessile to wheelchair users.</description>

Come and join us at the Back to the 80s party village for some Kraftwerk and Craftwork! This workshop consists of two parts. First we'll dive into the interesting lyrics of the German music group Kraftwerk. Already in the 1980s, they were working on data ethics. Computer love? Inspired by this band, we'll then do some crafting! You can make your own album cover, for your own imaginary (techno-critical?) band :)</description>

[https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/cheese2_why/ To secure spot on the Session 2. (Day 3, SUN 19h00) please sign in here.]


Each cheese tasting session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for this one (like three times overbooked). If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.

This event is based on '''donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds'''.

So lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!

To add your own cheese, add it to the wiki below

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

                <description>The need for digital sovereignty has always been great, but now there is an autocrat in the White house that is fighting everything he deems “Woke”. This renders USA Big Tech that is run by billionaires that have sworn loyalty to this new King unsuitable for use in education. Schools are yearning for a more fair digital environment, but most schools don’t have the funding, knowledge or capacity to create a public-values-by-design school IT environment with all the fantastic free and open source software that is out there. That is why we started the coalition for fair digital education,   so we can bring together the knowledge of free and opensource with the needs of the educational sector. In this presentation we'll present the WHY for the FOSS stack for schools, our plan how to get there, and the progress we have made so far on our pilot schools.</description>

                <description>Dutch Hacker Camp culture is deeply rooted in the ethos of openness, collaboration, and exploration. These camps are typically organized by volunteers from various hacker and maker communities in the Netherlands and attract participants from all over the world who are interested in technology, hacking, DIY culture, and digital freedom.

The Dutch hacker Camps are part of the larger series of international hacker camps, fitting in the rhythm of CCCamp (Germany) and EMF (UK), and not colliding with BornHack. Over the years, Dutch Hacker Camps have evolved and grown in size and popularity, attracting not only hackers and tech enthusiasts but also artists, activists, educators, and others who are passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and society.

This talk will take you through the history of Dutch Hacker Camps, and tell the story of the preparation for this one!</description>

                <abstract>Ever received a phishing simulation so painfully obvious it offended your intelligence? This talk is for you.

Join us as we turn the tables on corporate security theater and show how you can phish back, with humor, skill, and plausible deniability. Learn how to fingerprint your company’s phishing campaigns, spoof the spoofers, and maybe even get your CISO to click a link labeled “Definitely Not Malware.exe.”

This talk is part satire, part technical walkthrough, and all rebellion.</abstract>

                <description>Corporate phishing simulations are broken. You know it, I know it. And yet, every quarter, some overfunded awareness campaign lands in your inbox with all the subtlety of a Nigerian prince. The goal? To test whether you're “cyber aware.” The result? A war of attrition between InfoSec and the click-happy masses.

But what if we made visible what these simulations actually prove?

In this talk, we explore how to recognize and hack your organization's phishing simulations. Without getting fired (probably, no guarantees). From fingerprinting CISO-run campaigns using SPF records, consistent sender patterns and timing, to launching your own “counter-phishing” emails that prove how absurd the entire exercise is. 

We’ll walk through real-world tactics for flipping the script: phishing the phishers, automating chaos, and pushing back against checkbox security culture. All with a healthy dose of satire, social engineering, and plausible deniability.

If you’ve ever wanted to troll your security team for a good cause, this one’s for you. Just don’t click the link in the description.</description>

                <abstract>TETRA is a European standard for trunked radio used globally by police, military and civilian parties alike. In the past, we already published the hitherto secret inner workings of TETRA and on several of its severe security issues. 

We're now back to discuss the last crucial part of TETRA security - its optional (and costly) end-to-end encryption, reserved for the most sensitive use cases. We'll discuss in detail how we obtained and analyzed those elusive algorithms, and what we found.</abstract>

                <description>TETRA is a European standard for trunked radio used globally by police and military operators. Additionally, TETRA is widely deployed in industrial environments such as harbors and airports, as well as critical infrastructure such as SCADA telecontrol of pipelines, transportation and electric and water utilities.

In previous research, we published [TETRA:BURST](https://www.midnightblue.nl/tetraburst), revealing vulnerabilities in the TETRA air interface encryption, and publishing the secret cryptographic primitives for public scrutiny. We now present all-new material, assessing the optional and often expensive end-to-end encryption, which adds an additional layer of encryption on top of the air interface encryption, a layer that can only be decrypted by the traffic's recipient, and not by the infrastructure. 

These solutions enjoy significant end-user trust and are intended for the most sensitive of use cases. While the ETSI standard on TETRA does facilitate integration of some E2EE solution, the solutions themselves are vendor-proprietary, and proved quite hard to obtain.

The opaque nature of this solution and TETRA's history of offering significantly less security than advertised (including backdoored ciphers) is worrying enough, but given our previous TETRA:BURST research, E2EE is frequently mentioned as a potential mitigation. In order to shed light on its suitability, we decided to undertake the effort of reverse-engineering a TETRA E2EE solution.

We'll discuss how we investigated the E2EE landscape, and how we (after being scammed on a Motorola device) managed to extract an implementation from a popular Sepura radio. 

We'll then discuss the E2EE design (that we have published on GitHub) along with a security analysis, identifying several severe shortcomings ranging from the ability to inject voice traffic into E2EE channels and replay SDS (short text) messages to an intentionally weakened E2EE variant, which reduces its 128-bit key to only 56 bits.

In addition, we will discuss new findings related to multi-algorithm networks and official patches, relevant for asset owners mitigating the TETRA:BURST vulnerabilities previously uncovered by us.

Finally, we will demonstrate the E2EE voice injection attack as well as the previously theoretical TETRA packet injection attack on SCADA networks.</description>

                <description>This talk offers a deep dive into the infrastructure and operational models behind modern Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) phishing attacks. These aren't hobbyist scripts—they are mature, productized platforms that resemble legitimate SaaS offerings.

We explore how these platforms work under the hood:

How attackers deploy dockerized phishing kits

The use of CDNs, Telegram bots and proxy networks

Panel features like token capture, mailers, and multi-user support

Revenue models, actor branding, and upsells

We will showcase real examples of AiTM panels (including EvilProxy, Tycoon, Mamba2FA, and Raccoon), backed by original research and detection data gathered from over 2,000 incidents across hundreds of Microsoft 365 tenants. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of how these platforms scale, how attackers manage their infrastructure, and how defenders can detect and preempt them using techniques like pixel beacons and certificate transparency.</description>

                <abstract>Over the past few years, I’ve been casually poking around and stumbling upon exposed data and insecure infrastructure all across the telco ecosystem. From unsecured debug portals to full backend access, the leaks themselves might seem technically boring.

In this talk, I’ll walk through a handful of real-world cases, showing how misconfigurations, sloppy code, and forgotten interfaces can lead to serious exposures.</abstract>

                <description>These include:

* an eSIM provisioning portal exposed via unauthenticated debug web interface
* full backend access to a smartphone retail platform, including CRM data and hotline audio recordings
* publicly accessible SIM inventory systems, Call Data Records (CDRs), and even passport scans
* "open source" telco functions running in plain PHP, sometimes with hardcoded credentials
* …and more strange eSIM-related findings

This isn’t a high-end 0-day story. This is about minimal-effort, boring data leaks that still manage to have a surprisingly high impact. The talk will include examples, screenshots, and recurring patterns that keep coming up.</description>

                <description>I'd like to take you with me on how I build a generator for spherical lampshades. I'll talk about how math slowly turns into magic. 

The math is mainly trigonometry, so we can reminisce about highschool. But don't worry too much about it. It will be visualised, so everyone can follow along. 
The real magic happens when we introduce light into the equation, illuminating the creations in stunning ways. Plus, since this project is open source, you'll have the opportunity to craft your own unique lampshades! Or hack it into something else entirely...</description>

                <abstract>It's hard for a platform to have meaningful, useful ratings/reviews without both 
substantially Knowing Your Customer, engineering to detect manipulated reviews,
and responding in a nuanced way -- to increase a fraudster's costs, 
and not  just train them to hide better.  Lots of examples of diverse
platforms not doing a very good job of this.  (I'll also talk about how this 
knowledge sometimes leads platforms try to manipulate their own 
customers to maximize their sales).</abstract>

                <description>Ratings and reviews, although almost universally relied on by consumers, are, like
much other online info, often manipulated to increase sales, pump up merchant reputation 
but are sometimes used malicious to slam a competitor).

Even sites that only allow reviews from purchasers can be manipulated, particularly on platforms
when low cost products are sold. Ebay harbors fraudulent sellers by combining buyer and 
seller reputation, and not weighting by sale price. (So a 5 star rating for a trivial purchase accrues equal reputation as a large value sale.)

Many manipulations should be easily detectable by looking for some clear behavioral signatures, and then not training the adversaries by using adversary engineering rather than simply deactivating accounts. (I'll show you how to spot a lot of the red flags.)

Examples ranging from pumped up restaurant listings (up to #1 in London), Amazon 
and Ebay's problems, a puppy sales site that had a rating system so bad by design 
that they were sued by an animal rights org for facilitating fraud by puppy mills. 
(There are a lot of sick puppies out there...)</description>

                <title>Spectre in the real world: Leaking your private data from the cloud with CPU vulnerabilities</title>

                <abstract>Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities, like Spectre, have been making headlines since 2018. However, their most common critique is that these types of vulnerabilities are not really practical. Even though it is cool to leak `/etc/shadow` with a CPU bug, it has limited real-world impact. In this talk, we take Spectre out for a walk and let it see the clouds, by leaking memory across virtual machine boundaries at a public cloud provider, bypassing mitigations against these types of attacks.</abstract>

                <description>Seven years ago, Spectre and Meltdown were announced. These two vulnerabilities showed that instructions executed by the CPU might accidentally access secret data. This secret data can contain files cached from disk, cryptographic keys, private information, or anything else that might be stored in memory. An attacker can use Spectre to learn the value of that secret data, even though the attacker is not supposed to have access to it. 

Even though this sounds problematic, there is a reason why these type of vulnerabilities haven't had a significant real-world impact. Mitigations make it much harder to pull off, and an attacker needs a form of remote code execution anyway to trigger the relevant CPU instructions. If an attacker can already execute arbitrary code, then Spectre is probably not what you should be worried about. For regular users, these CPU vulnerabilities are likely not that much of a threat.

However, that is not the case for public cloud providers. Their business model is to provide *remote code execution as a service*, and to rent out shared hardware resources as efficiently as possible. Customers run their system in an seemingly isolated virtual machine on top of shared physical hardware. Because customers can run anything they want on these systems, public cloud providers must treat these workloads as untrusted. They have to assume the worst case scenario, i.e. that an attacker is deliberately trying violate the confidentiality, integrity or availability of their systems, and, by extension, their customers' systems. For transient execution vulnerabilities like Spectre, that means that they enable all reasonable mitigations, and some more.

In this talk, we show that transient execution attacks can be used on real-world systems, despite the deployed software mitigations. We demonstrate this by silently leaking secret data from another virtual machine at a major global cloud provider, defeating virtual machine isolation without leaving a trace. Additionally, we'll discuss our coordinated disclosure process, the currently deployed mitigations and how future mitigations could address the issue.</description>

                <description>MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors are miniature, highly precise components that detect motion, position, and environmental conditions. They are widely used in smartphones, cars, wearables, and smart home devices and are manufactured in specialized cleanrooms using advanced semiconductor processes.

This talk starts with a short introduction covering:

What are MEMS?
How are they made?
What can the Bosch BMI270 (6-axis IMU) and BME690 (gas, humidity, temperature, and pressure sensor) do?
After this overview, we’ll switch to a practical session: you’ll learn how to get started with MicroPython to access real-time sensor data on the WHY2025 Badge. By the end, you’ll be ready to experiment with your own ideas and prototypes based on the badge’s powerful sensing capabilities.</description>

                <description>TIC-80 fantasy console Byte Jam is a friendly competition to livecode a demo in a relaxed atmosphere. This can take an hour or more depending on the inspiration and time needed of the participants. You could follow the suggested random chosen topic or do your own thing.

TIC-80 is a fantasy console with limited resources like 240x136 pixels display, 16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound , etc. This gives the TIC-80 a very retro look and feel.

This byte jam is a good representation of the demoscene, where coders/hackers with very limited resources in hard or software make stunning audio and visual effects. In Europe the demoscene got status of cultural heritage in Finland, Germany and Polen and requested for Netherlands and other countries.

                <abstract>RAdio-frequency Detection And Ranging (RADAR) aims at using electromagnetic signals for detecting target location and motion. We demonstrate in this talk various RADAR architectures using dual-channel coherent Software Defined Radio (SDR) receivers and the associated signal processing techniques relying heavily on cross-correlations. Embedded systems are tackled, with a Raspberry Pi providing enough computational power for recording and post-processing.</abstract>

                <description>RAdio-frequency Detection And Ranging (RADAR) aims at using electromagnetic signals for detecting target location and motion. Being constantly illuminated with electromagnetic smog, we can benefit from existing radiofrequency emitters meeting RADAR requirements -- strong power and wide bandwidth -- for passive RADAR measurements where no active emitter is needed, using only coherent passive dual-channel Software Defined Radio (SDR) receivers for passive recording of existing signals. If existing signals are unsuitable, we can use the same principle with non-cooperative emitters such as a Wi-Fi dongle in an active RADAR setup. All processing flowcharts are implemented using GNU Radio for real time acquisition, and GNU/Octave or Python for post-processing: generic principles will be demonstrated, applicable to all sorts of receiver hardware. We will conclude with Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) where antenna motion is used to simulate wide aperture receiving antennas, adding azimuth resolution to range resolution.

                <description>In 2019 it was announced that XS4ALL as a brand and company would be integrated into KPN. What followed was a stormy year of customers rising up, employees resisting and frequent media coverage culminating in a court case which ultimately failed to preserve XS4ALL as an independent entity. How did the once happy union of XS4ALL and KPN turn sour, what events lead to the decision to integrate XS4ALL and what did the fight to preserve XS4AL look like from the inside? This talk will try to answer these questions and give insight into how the first consumer ISP from the Netherlands ultimately met its end.</description>

                <abstract>By 2025, an estimated 1.1 billion women globally will enter menopause, a natural, but misunderstood phase of life. This talk will address the stigma, myths, and misinformation surrounding menopause, focusing on the mental, physical, social, and economic challenges women face. It will also explore the struggles of LGBTQ+ individuals, often overlooked in discussions. The goal is to close the knowledge gap, empower women to advocate for their health, and foster a culture of support and inclusivity.</abstract>

                <description>Disclaimer: For the sake of simplicity, throughout this talk the term ‘women’ will be used when referring to individuals suffering the effects of menopause, however this information is relevant for all individuals born with female reproductive organs.

Menopause remains shrouded in stigma, silence, and common misinformation, leaving many women unsupported and uninformed. Myths and a lack of understanding about menopause contribute to confusion, fear, and inadequate care.
It will go beyond the well-known symptoms to uncover the diverse range of life changing symptoms women face during menopause.
By openly discussing menopause and moving beyond the idea of 'fixing' women the focus can instead be on building a culture that recognizes and respects the diverse challenges for all women at every stage of life.</description>

                <description>In today's digital landscape, protecting one's online presence can be a daunting task. I am a former marketeer who back in 2018 got inspired by "The Privacy, Security and OSINT Show" podcast, a podcast whom disappeared from the internet. This was also the time that in Europe the GDPR was still being implemented and techniques on how to protect your digital footprint started to differ a lot from practices in the US. 
With the rise of data breaches, and online harassment, individuals must navigate a complex web of regulations and best practices to safeguard and stay in control over their personal information. 
I ported many techniques to my own life in Europe and share my experiences in trying to remove myself from the internet. This talk explores the intricacies of online privacy, by leveraging the of GDPR and tooling to influence your online exposure. 
 I share my experiences with trying to remove myself from the internet and the mistakes that taught me about real-life implications. I hope to help navigate more people to a holistic approach to personal data protection whom I now pursue.</description>

                <abstract>In 2017 (just before SHA2017) the Dutch healthcare sector came together to create Stichting Z-CERT, the Zorg Computer Emergency Response Team. A nonprofit to protect and advise the Dutch Healthcare sector. What started as a small startup has now grown into a scaleup with the ambitions to match.
A lot has changed in the 3 years since the last talk about Z-CERT. In this talk we will:
- Tell who we are
- Show what we do
- Give a little peak behind the curtain how we do that</abstract>

                <description>In 2017 a large corporation announced that they wanted to build a water theme park in a small forest that I had known from my childhood. Immediately an overwhelming feeling of injustice came over me. Why would you sacrifice the future of our children for a theme park? It turned out a number of neighbours had the same feeling. We decided to draw a line in the sand.
For seven years we fought a battle with the corporation and the government, and the whole time everybody was telling us this was a fight we could not win.
In 2024 we won that fight. It turned out it wasn’t just luck. We created a plan, and we stuck to it. Since then we have been sharing our experiences with other organisations. Fatalism can be your greatest enemy, but it doesn’t have to be. Welcome to the rebellion.</description>

This presentation will showcase how dev, ops, but also security management can be transparent about dependency versioning and known vulnerabilities, while also staying on track with updates.
It will show demos of Open Source Standards like SBOM and Frameworks like Dependency-Check, Dependency-Track and Renovate that can help automate the sadness of today's supply chain issues.</abstract>

                <description>The Four Freedoms of Social Media: A Bill of Rights for Digital Communities

Just as free software has the Four Freedoms, our digital communities need Four Freedoms for Social Media—fundamental rights that ensure people, not corporations, control their online spaces. Social media today is defined by surveillance, manipulation, and arbitrary control—but it doesn’t have to be.

This talk lays out what we must demand from social protocols:
	1.	The Freedom to Connect – No one should be prevented from communicating or organizing due to corporate interests or government pressure.
	2.	The Freedom to Move – Users and communities must be able to leave one platform and take their relationships, content, and identity elsewhere.
	3.	The Freedom to Understand &amp; Control Algorithms – People should know how their feeds are shaped and have the power to change them.
	4.	The Freedom to Self-Govern – Communities should set their own rules, rather than being subject to arbitrary moderation and deplatforming.

Technologies like AT Protocol (BlueSky), ActivityPub (the Fediverse), and Nostr offer glimpses of this future, but they must be built around these freedoms—not just as features, but as non-negotiable principles.

This talk isn’t just about what’s possible—it’s about what we must demand from the next generation of social protocols. The future of digital communities should belong to us—not corporations.</description>

                <abstract>Fuzzing is one of the most effective ways to find elusive software vulnerabilities. Despite years of research, general purpose fuzzers such as AFL++ and Libfuzzer struggle to mutate complex data structures effectively, preventing them from exploring deep functionality. Grammar fuzzing, an alternative fuzzing strategy is much more effective but complex to setup and run. Autarkie abstracts away all complexity and and surpasses all other grammar fuzzers in performance while offering novel features.</abstract>

                <description>Gone are the days of finding bugs in the parser or on the surface of applications. The bugs now lie in the core application logic, well beyond the parser. Fuzzing complex targets such as interpreters, databases or network protocols  has always been difficult due to their strict input structures.  Autarkie was born out of the need of fuzzing complex and evolving data structures with the convenience of fuzzers such as AFL++. Autarkie leverages a simple insight: the target needs to parse the input, so it must define the structure internally. Macros could be used to gain insight into the structure and build a grammar fuzzer. 

Autarkie does not just out perform all other grammar fuzzers, but also offers novel features such as removing grammar derivation and maintenance, ability to learn from other fuzzers, constraint solving and resumable fuzzing campaigns. 

Join me for this talk where I go through Autarkie's internals, features, and its development journey.
I will also talk about my journey hunting for bugs with Autarkie and hopefully convince you to use it on yours.</description>

                <abstract>When embedded into JavaScript, WebAssembly modules can be "sandboxed" by defining a limited set of _imports_. It turns out that an obscure "feature" allows us to craft an exploit which bypasses this barrier, enabling us to run arbitrary JavaScript code from within a malicious WASM module. All within spec... by accident?</abstract>

                <description>When talking about WebAssembly, the word "sandbox" comes up often: modules are isolated from eachother, and from the host runtime.
Hence, it is perfectly safe to run untrusted WASM modules (e.g. plugins) in a web-app: the module's interfaces can be limited, making it such that any malicious code has no way of escaping.

... is what I thought.

In this talk I will show how a sneaky specification detail allows us to program a JavaScript version of a _weird machine_, to eventually escape from WebAssembly into running arbitrary JavaScript code. This trick is fully in-spec and requires no actual browser exploitation (we don't break _that_ sandbox). Hence, this talk should be accessible for anyone with a basic JavaScript understanding. No WebAssembly experience is required: I will cover everything required to understand the exploit.</description>

                <description>Many talks mentioned cryptography somewhere along the presentation and everybody just nods. But how many people actually know the insights of cryptography? Why some things work and some things don't? During this talk I will explain the difference between encoding and encryption, the most common uses of cryptography, the difference between synchronous and asynchronous encryption, hashes. I will include some history and some future developments like quantum and why we call cryptocoin cryptocoin. In a slow pace, scratching the surface for uninitiated, but the scratches will go deep enough for more initiated to get some more background.</description>

                <description>This talk will explain how to configure modern security standards on your domain name with the help of [the open source](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/) [Internet.nl](https://internet.nl). It will show common misconfigurations in DNS and security headers. Teach you why you should probably want to avoid `www CNAME @`, want to enable IPv6 and other observations from the [biannual measurements](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/metingen/informatieveiligheidstandaarden) of scanning more than 10.000 governmental host names in The Netherlands.

After this talk you'll know at least one DNS or security header improvement for your own or organization domain.

This presentation will touch:
- why enable DNSSEC ([RFC 4033](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4033) and many more), some common failures (e.g. CNAME's)
- why enable IPv6, not talking about 'IPv4-mapped IPv6 address' here, issues if you're still not supporting IPv6 (almost 30 years after [RFC 1883](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1883))
- why not CNAME to your apex domain (if you have an Mx record)
- why use Null MX ([RFC 7505](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7505))
- why configuration SPF ([RFC 7208](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208)) on all hostnames
- why there are more reasons to avoid CNAME's
- why enable DANE ([RFC 6698](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6698)) and TLSRPT ([RFC 8460](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8460)) and why it's superior to MTA-STA ([RFC 8461](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461)), how to rotate DANE
- why monitoring matters
- why first doing a `https://` redirect before a domain redirect
- why a strict Content-Security-Policy ([CSP v3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/)) will save you
- why configure `ssl_reject_handshake` (nginx only)
- why have an accessible security.txt (special allow rule if you have basic auth!) that contains at least one email address
- why start cookie names with `__Host-`or `__Secure-` ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#cookie-namecookie-value))</description>

                <abstract>live-bootstrap is a worthy attempt to provide a reproducible, automatic, complete end-to-end bootstrap from a minimal number of binary seeds to a supported fully functioning operating system. Although it is starts with a minimal binary seed of only 280 bytes it also depends on a lot of other sources. What are those sources exactly and how can we review these to make sure that live-bootstrap can be trusted?</abstract>

                <description>In the past two years, I spend studying stage0 of the live-bootstrap project in order to understand how it works, to find out on what sources it depends, and to create an interactive documentation hopefully helping others to understand it and review the sources.

In this process, I have written programs to interpret the kaem scripts, an emulator for stage0, and a program to analyze the strace output and generate a T-diagram.

In the presentation, I will talk about the steps I have taken, present the results, and also discuss ways to simplify the stage0 sources, such as developing a C-compiler targeted for compiling the Tiny C Compiler using a small stack based languages as intermediate language.

                <abstract>During this talk we look at hardware and firmware reverse engineering, but also at corporate intimidation tactics and how to respond ethically as a security researcher.
Leveraging the hard-coded AES keys, outdated software, and lots and lots of custom code we found, we were able to install "custom code" on some phones and access global customer configuration data by exploiting Yealink's global cloud provisioning service (RPS).</abstract>

                <description>Communication is the cornerstone of human collaboration and vital to functional governments, flourishing businesses, and our personal lives. We take for granted that sensitive information we send through our digital communication infrastructure is only received by the intended recipient.
This puts immense responsibility on communication equipment manufacturers and service providers to keep our communications safe from prying eyes. Surely we can trust a global, leading manufacturer of video conferencing, voice communication and collaboration solutions to keep our data safe, right? ...right?
They may have shiny devices and their marketing slides might be impressive, but we care about what's on the inside.
In this talk, we take a look at Yealink VoIP business phones and their cloud infrastructure.
Come with us on a technical deep dive involving hardware hacking and firmware reverse engineering, but also listen to a story about corporate intimidation tactics and lessons on how not to treat security researchers.
What we find is a security researcher's dream: hard-coded AES keys, outdated software, and lots and lots of custom C code (including cryptography!).
We were not only able to run custom code on some phones, but were also able to access configuration data of their global cloud provisioning service while casually answering the age-old question: "Does it run DOOM?".
This project concluded in a wide-ranging coordinated vulnerability disclosure involving the manufacturer, telecom providers, national cybersecurity agencies, and major customers, which we will also outline in this talk.</description>

                <description>You have seen many diagrams of computer and information systems in your career. They have been around since the early days of computing. They can be useful, but there are a few typical problems with them:
•	They are drawn with obscure symbols that are only understood by architects
•	They are drawn in an inconsistent way
•	They are not used to their fullest potential.
In my practice I have run into these problems often, and I have found ways to turn a certain type of diagram, a simplified version of deployment diagrams, into the cornerstone of explanation of what goes on in cloud and cybersecurity.
In the talk I will lead you through the basic principles, and a few examples. This will enable you to lead architecture conversations and discuss their security options. I will use examples such as key/encryption architectures, DevOps, and even your home music system.</description>

                <abstract>The Light and Music entertainment platform Lightupyourbanjo began in 2010 when “Cash-a-billy with a Bluegrass bite” band Ed and the Fretmen wanted to have better lights on their banjo. They developed banjo lights with addressable LEDs for in and outside mounting showing interactive animations, written in C++ supporting the songs, and wrote songs to support the lights. In 2025 the Lightupyourbanjo bands will be fighting the darkness with the new O4 model build into their 3 banjos.</abstract>

                <abstract>I want to talk about how we are setting the standards for our digital world and society. Now that our whole world and everything in it seems to have become a business case for for-profit digitalisation, we are purposefully driven to use off the shelve, inflexible, data-absorbing and exploitative products marketed to us by big companies. Can standards help change that? And how do we do that?</abstract>

                <description>Here at WHY we are all curious about everything technical and, on average, also pretty adept at working with digital nails and hammers. But even so, these big companies drive out many grassroots alternatives, making it harder and harder to set your own course. 
And not just that. It is not everybody’s forte to ‘do digitalisation’. If not, you still deserve a decent quality product. Maybe you should not be tricked into handing over all your data to marketing companies, including pretty private information. And with promises of big profits come the investors, the people that don’t care about the product but instead focus on profit margins and return on investment - with varying levels of appreciation of trivialities like workers rights or environmental protection. (/s)

Europe, and the Netherlands, has something to protect though, like the right not to be surveilled by big tech and employers, to have a high quality education system and medical devices that are catered to finding ailments rather than to selling medical interventions for instance. It also has a responsibility to ensure people outside of Europe are not abused and exploited for the products we use to enlighten our lives and avoid further climate catastrophe because we all want to make our own individual generated film of Will Smith slurping spaghetti.

In the past decade(s), the EU has worked with the New Legislative Framework, the idea that standards organisations develop the ‘how to comply’ options that industry can use to make a product that is presumed to be in accordance with the European rules. This takes time and in AI we see the backlash of trying to do this for an area where there really isn’t a ‘state of the art’ yet. Much of it is still just experiments, and rules need to be in place before evaluation of experiments has even started. And hardly anyone is daring enough to address the question of sustainability with regards to the enormous demands of generative AI models, and the words copyrights and creator are nowhere to be found. 

I actually have little answers at all, iI wish I knew. I do however have a desire to ask: why are we not talking about this? Why are we not demanding the return on investment results of extremely demanding and expensive tools for our society? And why are we avoiding to remind the very few enormous companies (and their owners) making all the money that they need to pay for the costs of their resources they are ruthlessly seizing from our public domain? Why do we leave this depletion to individuals to solve - to the individual creator to go to court, to the tiny village where the water is being depleted, where is the support of those we need to help to stand up to this exhaustion? &lt;b&gt;Can we please ask ourselves where ALL THIS will be addressed &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it is too late?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

                <abstract>Serendiep is a 42m inland cargo barge with a theatre, a fablab and an art/science labyrinth on board. It's being converted to electric propulsion using second hand EV parts and hardware from openinverter. The ultimate goal is to harvest all the energy needed from solar panels mounted on the hatches covering the cargo hold.</abstract>

                <description>Sailing is among the most efficient modes of cargo transport. Yet in the much needed transition away from fossil it seems to be falling behind other sectors.
We set ourselves the challenge to be sailing electrically, to harvest the energy needed on the ship itself, and to do all this with open tech and second hand parts, taking advantage of an upcoming category of e-waste and achieving a minimal budget as a result.
In this talk we'll present a rundown of all the hurdles on the way, how they were overcome or which consequences they have for thoroughly low impact transport.</description>

                <abstract>Pwn2Own Ireland added a new target in the smarthome category: the Aeotec Smart Hub. We assumed this target would be an easy win. However, getting the firmware of this device turned out te be a lot harder than anticipated. First, we had to modify the board to dump the encrypted flash. Then, we abused a secure boot flaw to get the decryption key. This process took so long, we had no time left to look for vulnerabilities, but our approach may be interesting for others looking at similar targets.</abstract>

                <description>Usually extracting the firmware of an IoT device is easy. The firmware is often not encrypted on flash and debug interfaces such as UART are often exposed and left open. This was our assumption when we started investigation the Aeotec. However, we turned out to be very wrong on our assumptions. 

The Aeotec firmware is actually encrypted on flash, with a key that is stored in OTP. Furthermore, all debug interfaces such as UART were closed down. This meant we needed  to go through great lengths, first doing in-circuit dumping of the flash, then breaking the encryption configuration in order to get code execution on the APCPU.

Our goal was to do vulnerability research, but we ran out of time for that. By sharing our process, we hope to help others who are interested in this or other devices with a similar configuration.</description>

                <abstract>For a good decade now, containerisation has been a popular solution: Addressing issues such as security, fault tolerance, and scalability, it has turned into a mainstay in IT. Though with a technology that ubiquitous, it does deserve investigation whether it has been put to good use or rather pressed into service.</abstract>

                <description>This talk includes a brief history of container solutions while challenging a number of common assumptions. While geared at a more seasoned audience, the presentation is very much from the perspective of the ‘plumbing layers,’ which comes with the discussion of many core concepts of Docker/OCI. Hence this should be beginner-friendly to a degree.

Mild audience participation is to be expected; may contain traces of DevOps.

                <abstract>You want to learn more about Linux permissions? This is the talk for you. Let's learn about the basic UID/GID concepts in Linux and expand into more complex ACLs. Then escalating on the "everything-is-a-file" concept and applying the learned security logic onto program behavior using SELinux or AppArmor.</abstract>

                <description>The first point a "normal" user encounters Linux permissions, is often when he wants to execute a downloaded file (from the internet) - requiring him to set the executable-bit... But this one bit is just a part of a much larger world of the Linux permissions - starting with the usual umask-reduced "drwxrwxr-x" and including access-contol-lists for more complex scenarios. The learned concepts can then be applied onto not only files, but also devices (e.g. using udev)... Most users also know how to bypass "Permission Denied" touble (by just using "sudo"), but how does that actually work?
But managing access to files and devices from the users perspective is just one side of Linux security, as one can also apply these filtering logic onto system-calls programs make: For this we will take a quick look into SELinux and AppArmor, two of the more popular hardening frameworks and how their rulesets work.</description>

                <description>This talk introduces MIAUW — Methodology for Information Security Assessment with Audit Value — a structured approach to penetration testing that goes beyond technical exploits to deliver legal defensibility, governance value, and repeatable insight.

We begin with a familiar problem: many pentests are technically sound but fail to produce lasting impact. Reports are delivered, risks are noted — and then nothing changes. There’s little accountability, no alignment with organizational processes, and limited value for oversight.

MIAUW changes that. It brings structure, traceability, and dual accountability by involving not just the pentester, but also a dedicated auditor. Every step — from planning and scenario definition to execution, reporting, and organizational learning — is part of a documented process. The auditor produces a formal protocol, providing legal and governance-grade assurance over the findings.

In this session, we’ll cover:
- How MIAUW works: from the first conversation to the final deliverables.
Why including an auditor raises the bar for quality, traceability, and board-level trust.
- Real-world stories of organizations that transformed their security posture through structured offensive testing.
- How to get started with MIAUW, even when working with external testing partners.
Whether you're a CISO, security consultant, internal auditor or board advisor, this talk will challenge the way you think about pentests — and show you how to make every test a reusable asset for control and improvement.</description>

                <abstract>Learn how to build end-to-end encrypted social apps including the newly released Bitchat using Nostr and MLS (Messaging Layer Security). We'll go from Nostr basics through to encrypted groups, explore the open source libraries and apps already in production, and show how to build your own. Includes live coding demonstrating how to create secure, private social tools that actually scale. You'll leave knowing how to build real e2e apps using tested, working tools.</abstract>

                <description>Building truly private social applications isn't just about adding encryption - it's about rethinking how we build social spaces. By combining Nostr's decentralized protocol with MLS's efficient group encryption, we can create social apps that are both private and practical. 

The talk walks through:

Technical Foundation:
- How Nostr works: events, relays, and NIPs
- Understanding MLS tree-based group key management
- Implementing encrypted groups that actually scale
- Real-world performance and security considerations

Practical Building:
- Tour of working libraries
- Open source apps you can use today
- Common implementation challenges and solutions
- Live coding of a basic encrypted group chat

Beyond the Code:
- Why traditional platform encryption fails
- How forking solves community governance
- Building tools that empower rather than control
- Real examples from nos.social and communities.nos.social

You'll leave understanding not just the protocols, but how to build real applications that respect privacy and community autonomy. We'll look at actual code running in production, discuss practical challenges we've solved, and show how you can start building your own encrypted social tools today.

This isn't just theory - everything shown is running in production now. Whether you're interested in cryptography, social protocols, or just want to build better tools for human communication, you'll get concrete knowledge you can use.

Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with public key cryptography helpful but not required. Examples will use JavaScript/TypeScript but concepts apply to any language.</description>

Within the realm of IT, there is a great number of bass players. They carry the music for all organizations. There is great power in this role, and as we all know: with great power comes great responsibility. In this presentation, we will be looking into the ethics of bass playing.</abstract>

                <description>In a band, bass players can play different roles. In most cases, the role of the bass player is a supporting one. However, there are multiple ways of playing the bass: you can support from the shadows, but also take a more central place. You can be laid back and lazy, but also driving the band forward. In any case, you can steer the band, even though you're not the front person. Not many musicians consider the bass player the most important person in the band, but that is mainly because they never look under the surface.

In a professional team, you might consider yourself a bass player: you keep the music flowing, try to be not too obvious, but all the time making sure that everyone can play their part. Within the realm of IT, there is a great number of bass players. They carry the music for all organizations. There is great power in this role, and as we all know from Voltaire (well, most will know it from Uncle Ben): with great power comes great responsibility. 

In this presentation, we will be looking into the ethics of bass playing. And the bass is in itself a very ethical instrument: while guitars are often distorted, basses are generally played clean. And obviously, special attention will be given to upright bass playing, as this shapes the core of ethical musicianship.</description>

                <description>The Offworld Voyage M.A.R.S. Tesseract Space Analog Simulation Habitats were designed with a zero waste ethos for minimal environmental impact by inventor Scott Beibin and visual wizard Michael Flood. The modular and portable structures of the habitats include: a bio-dome for cultivating organic vegan plant-based and fungi-based nutrition sources, autonomous power production, advanced waste reclamation, a science laboratory for experimentation and research, a space medicine bay, a fabrication lab for prototyping and repair, facilities for fitness and creativity as well as a kitchen and living quarters.
 
Mission immersions incorporate a vision of the future when space has become accessible to all through the use of emerging ecologically sustainable appropriate technologies enabled by new types of egalitarian economic structures and coordination methods.
 
Crew activities include EVA explorations in pressurized space suits outfitted with bio-sensors, 3D printed construction using regolith, utilization of open source communications tools, cooperative governance exercises and the practice of mutual aid and consensus decision making in mission planning, problem-solving and self-sufficiency challenges in the face of extreme resource scarcity, simulated time-delayed communications and experiments to analyze the effects of isolation on astronauts during offworld missions.
 
The inaugural mission for the M.A.R.S. Tesseract habitats will occur in a remote desert location in the near future. It will include the founders of the project, Scott Beibin and Elizabeth Jane Cole, who are both alumni of the Mars Desert Research Station (Mission 286) and core committee members of the Journal for Space Analog Research.
 
Future plans for the project include the development of pressurized facilities and closed loop systems, as well as development of public goods including hardware and software for Space Analog Research and S.T.E.A.M based educational programs.</description>

                <description>Hi, I am Dana and work as a teamtrainer / outdoor guide. I work with kids, teens, adults - and I am ever so often amazed how easy and fast we are connecting with each other while moving and laughing and trying to do more or less ridiculous tasks. We would meet somewhere on a field and do a lot of playing and trying stuff. I am very looking forward to having fun and inspiring (a bit of) our muscles and minds together :o)
Most of the games and exercises are suitable for persons in wheelchairs or otherwise bodily constricted; we will take whatever challenge it takes to find adaptions for the tasks at hand, so everyone can join in.
HOW MANY: min 8, max 30 persons.
HOW OLD: min. 6 years old, only when accompanied by an adult.
HOW LONG: 30-90 min (however the requests...)
HOW OFTEN: I don´t know: maybe every day except the last? 
WHEN: a good time would be around 10:00 in the mornings or later in the evening, (maybe 17:00), depending how hot the weather would be and if we would find a place in shadows</description>

                <abstract>In this 90 min workshop, you will build and test your own propane flamethrower. You can buy a kit from us or bring your own parts. We will use a tried-and-tested design. We will start with the theory and principles behind propane flame effects, followed by how to play safely with big flames. The second part is the guided, hands-on, step-by-step process of building your own. At the end, we will test the flamethrowers in a nearby area.</abstract>

                <description>The workshop has 8 to 10  tables for building available. Please let me know via why2025@area42.industries if you would like to attend and build so that we can reserve a table for you.  

We can provide complete kits at cost, and we will also provide a limited amount of propane for testing. Please note that if you bring your own kit, we cannot guarantee that it will fit together and work reliably.  Building flamethrowers is mainly a plumbing problem: getting the right fittings and materials is the key.  

The kit details are available in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnqjfUdFHPhpqA8Jq59G56lh4KdznPbwPEVS6Ctg960/edit?usp=sharing)

If you want us to provide the kit at cost, please contact me at why2025@area42.industries. I expect the cost to be between 200-250 euros. If you just need the fire extinguisher then let me know as well.</description>

                <abstract>AI is ubiquitous. Where it isn't now, it will probably be soon, in software and operating systems. More often the usage guidelines are also unilaterally changed to companies utilising our data to train their models. While I've previously focused on building safer AI, now I also teach people how to hack them and build playgrounds for people to experiment. In this workshop I bring my hackable AI apps for people to play around with and hack so we may all learn new and necessary skills. Come play!</abstract>

                <abstract>You know those people that take a balloon, inflate it and after some twisting, turning, and some squicky noises they end up with a balloon creature?

You could be one!

Because, baloon folding isn't that hard, actually.

I have the balloons, instructions and will actually try to teach during this workshop as well.

Are you an adult and know how to do this, I could sure use some help to survive the chaos ;)

                <abstract>Ben jij tussen de 8 en 14 jaar en wil je leren hoe je technologie kunt gebruiken om zelf een slim huis, inbraakalarm of weerstation te bouwen? Dan is deze CoderDojo workshop echt iets voor jou!

Tijdens deze workshop ga je aan de slag met Codecraft, een blok-gebaseerde programmeertaal (zoals Scratch, maar dan krachtiger!). Hiermee programmeer je een Arduino-microcontroller en verbind je allerlei Seeed Grove-sensoren om de temperatuur te meten of inbrekers te detecteren.</abstract>

                <description>👨‍💻 Wat gaan we doen?
    Je leert hoe een microcontroller werkt
    Je programmeert in Codecraft
    Je maakt je eigen project zoals een:
    - Inbraakalarm
    - Slim lichtsysteem
    - Weerstation
    En natuurlijk testen we alles uit in het echt!

🎒 Wat moet je meebrengen?
    Een eigen laptop (Windows of Mac)
    Installeer vooraf de gratis Codecraft-software via deze link:
    👉 https://ide.tinkergen.com/download/en/
    Ben je jonger dan 10? Neem dan ook een oudere begeleider mee die je kan helpen

🧠 Geen ervaring met programmeren? Geen probleem!
We beginnen vanaf nul. Als je nieuwsgierig bent, graag dingen bouwt of ooit al met Scratch gewerkt hebt, dan zit je hier helemaal goed!

Sessions will be given in dutch but we can accommodate english participants.</description>

                <description>Are you fascinated by space and want to learn how to receive data from satellites and weather probes? In this TinyGS station workshop, you’ll build and program your ground station and antenna to receive data from space. This hands-on, beginner-friendly workshop is perfect for anyone interested in radio, electronics, IOT, antenna design, and space exploration. TinyGS is an open community-run network of ground stations distributed around the world to receive and operate LoRa satellites, weather probes, and other flying objects, using cheap and versatile modules. With a TinyGS ground station, you can receive data from a variety of sources, such as CubeSats. During the workshop, you’ll learn how to build and program a TinyGS ground station and a quarter-wave ground plane antenna. No prior experience is required.

                <description>The Pathlighter PCB, initially known as the Glow Club PCB, is a wearable piece of PCB art crafted for the community. It serves a dual purpose: as a practical tool for teaching about LEDs and soldering, and as a creative demonstration of using a PCB’s foundational layers to craft a unique art piece. Designed to be worn on a lanyard, the Pathlighter PCB acts as a beacon, lighting up the night and ensuring safety for its wearers.

This innovative PCB made its debut in an electronics education group and has since been featured in soldering workshops at ToorCamp 2022 and Chaos Communication Camp ’23. Its design is particularly well-suited for larger events where workshop demand often outstrips available resources. The Pathlighter PCB’s efficient design allows newcomers to complete their project in approximately 20 minutes. This swift completion rate creates a “revolving door” dynamic in the workshop, allowing for a continuous flow of participants and maximizing educational outreach.

Having been taught to over 450 students so far, the Pathlighter PCB workshop has been a delightful experience to teach students how to solder and to earn a unique wearable art piece. Each participant not only learns valuable skills but also becomes an honorary member of the Glow Club. May we all shine brighter together through these shared experiences.

Making the grid smart is part of the solution, but present its owns set of challenges, because by controlling and manipulating a lot of small consumers or producers at the same time, an attacker can still have a large effect on the grid.
DIVD currently has a research project (https://www.divd.nl/energie/) devoted to this and Hamza and Alexandros are researchers in this project.
In this talk they will show you how they attack smart energy systems using a Honeywell Smart Thermostat as an example device.
After the presentation the presenters will stick around the D42D area/cluster where there will be plenty of devices for you to try and hack and maybe even earn your own CVE.</description>

                <abstract>De VPRO bewaarde krantenknipsels over hacken, hackers en computercriminaliteit en die heb ik uit de prullenbak kunnen redden. Titels als "Veel te veel hitsige nerds of What the Hack", "De eigentijdse misdadiger gebruikt een beeldscherm" en "Koernikova-computervirus komt uit Sneek" inspireerden me om deze "Hacker nostalgie" te geven die toeschouwers gegarandeerd "oud" of "jong" zal laten voelen.</abstract>

                <description>A collection of interactive installations connects art with (complex) science. Theories and model systems from the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics and more are at the base of intriguing images, sounds and texts that you yourself produce. Or is it the other way around?
Caution: The access to the labyrinth is at your own risk. Wear comfortable clothes. High heels are not recommended. Children have to be supervised at all times. Unfortunately the Labyrinth is not accessile to wheelchair users.</description>

                <description>Altough the same “rules” apply, when we raise the frequency, we have to take a lot more phenomena into account. That is why “Microwave Technology” is often considered as “black art”, but it is fun!! During this talk I will take you into the fascinating world of cm and mm waves. A true 122 GHz setup will be demonstrated.

                <abstract>I love my Sanyo MBC-555 computer from 1983. It’s a NOT-so-IBM-compatible 8088 PC. It has no real ROM-BIOS and a very inconvenient VRAM mapping. It shipped with MS-DOS 1.25, Sanyo BASIC and DEBUG.COM. That got me into 8088 assembly programming back in the days (1993).</abstract>

This event is run by František [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvasírna Jara] project which is a commercial one. 

'''Aims&amp;Selection'''
The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more "complex" "natural ciders" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poirés (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poiré which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.

'''Style'''
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid "commercialization" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace.

This tasting event is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.

== Workshop Description == 
The Pathlighter PCB, initially known as the Glow Club PCB, is a wearable piece of PCB art crafted for the community.
It serves a dual purpose: as a practical tool for teaching about LEDs and soldering, and as a creative demonstration of using a PCB’s foundational layers to craft a unique art piece. Designed to be worn on a lanyard, the Pathlighter PCB acts as a beacon, lighting up the night and ensuring safety for its wearers.  
  
This innovative PCB made its debut in an electronics education group and has since been featured in soldering workshops at ToorCamp 2022 and Chaos Communication Camp ’23. Its design is particularly well-suited for larger events where workshop demand often outstrips available resources. The Pathlighter PCB’s efficient design allows newcomers to complete their project in approximately 20 minutes. This swift completion rate creates a “revolving door” dynamic in the workshop, allowing for a continuous flow of participants and maximizing educational outreach.  
  
Having been taught to over 450 students so far, the Pathlighter PCB workshop has been a delightful experience to teach students how to solder and to earn a unique wearable art piece. Each participant not only learns valuable skills but also becomes an honorary member of the Glow Club. May we all shine brighter together through these shared experiences.

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

                <abstract>Wikipedia tells us that _low-background steel_ is steel produced before the detonation of the first nuclear bombs. Yep, you guessed it, **this is a talk about Large Language Models**. LLM outputs have quickly spread like radionuclides, threatening everything from the scientific record to the existence of the Internet as we know it. In this talk I'll discuss _practical small web approaches_ that we can use to build a new Internet that doesn't suck quite so badly. There will also be memes ;-)</abstract>

                <description>Have you noticed how the **good stuff** on the Internet is increasingly hidden behind bot checks, subscriptions and paywalls? And that it's getting harder and harder to find things online due to LLM pollution? Welcome to the club! You are in the right place.

In this talk I'll highlight some of the most egregious examples, consider how we can best preserve _low background information_ for future generations, and how we can use small web techniques like **self-hosted blogs and static site generators** to bootstrap a new infosphere that doesn't rely on a handful of _hyperscale operators_.

I'm particularly interested in how we can _federate and syndicate search_, learning from protocols and standards like RSS and ActivityPub. As part of the talk I'll give you some practical tools and approaches to try. If you find this interesting, consider joining us in the [SearchClub](https://matrix.to/#/#searchclub:matrix.org). **Let's have fun building the new Internet together!**</description>

                <description>OpenStreetMap is an open database of geodata and has become the biggest geodataset of the world. It is often called 'the wikipedia of maps' and is getting used in more and more applications - from grassroot movements to big corporations. A tremendous lot is possible, but it can be confusing to get started and to dive into the ecosystem.

In this talk, I'll give a high-level overview of OpenStreetMap and answer the most important questions:

- What is OpenStreetMap (and what is it not?)
- What applications exist?
- What tools exist?
- How can one contribute?
- How can one export data?
- How can one get in touch with the local mapping community?

No previous experience with mapping or GIS needed! This is a talk, so you don't have to bring anything. However, if you need some help with your first OSM-edits, I'll stick around after the talk to get you started. In that case, it might be useful to bring your laptop (or smartphone)</description>

                <description>Credential theft is on the rise. Cybercriminals are gettings smarter and more efficient. Why hack in, if you can log in?

At the DIVD we see this trend in the cases where we assist with notifying victims of credential theft. Where our first such cases started with a mere threehundred-something credentials we are now sometimes faced with credential dumps that contains millions of even billions of credentials. 

How can we scale this up, what problems did we face, how did we solve them, and what haven;t we solved yet?</description>

                <abstract>After some internal evaluation and a journalists inquiry on the possibility of chinese state actors having access to camera footage, Muncipality the Hague decided to do a security test focused on an APT threat on their traffic camera infrastructure. During the session we will show how the team approached this project, how some of the cinematic scenarios of causing traffic jams and using the camera's for espionage were possible in real life and what lessons were learned from the project.</abstract>

                <description>The session will start with providing a bit of context on why the project was started, what was already going on at that time and why the muncipality of the Hague had further questions for which they needed a hacking team.
We then discuss how we approached the project in a complex environment, where APT threats are involved and how that changes how you assess certain systems and features.
The core of the presentation focuses on disclosing the actual vulnerabilities found within the systems, how we went through the full cyber kill chain within the environment and what that actually means in the physical realm if this had been exploited with malicious intent. 
Finally we end the presentation with some details on how the discovered issues were addressed and what general lessons can be learned from this project that could also be applicable for other similar environments.</description>

                <abstract>A team of Dutch scientist and cloud engineers is working on Ecofed: European Cloud Services in an Open Federated Ecosystem. The objective and scope of the ECOFED project are to develop a technical framework for a more open and integrated cloud usage model. This framework will enable multiple clouds from various providers to function as a single, cohesive system, offering a European alternative to hyperscaler clouds. In this open cloud ecosystem, users can easily switch between different clouds.</abstract>

                <description>After critically following the elections for 8 years from the outside, a hacker was employed as one of the functional administrators of the software supporting the elections. Sharing experiences of the use of election software during 7 elections (2020-2023), from local, national to European in The Netherlands.

A governmental software project with strict deadlines, and high security expectations. The software project for elections in The Netherlands is build an IT organization owned by German local governments. More than 10.000 Java files, what can possible go wrong?

During this time multiple emergency patches were needed and incidents occur. Although at first explicitly not hired as a coder, within 3 months a Java code contribution was made that was unexpectedly more crucial than anticipated.

This talk will show some incidents with the election software in The Netherlands: how the software failed, and when/how it was discovered. Go over how seeing the elections from the outside, and give some history of voting computers and software. Ending with some reflecting on the future.</description>

                <description>"The software used in elections is developed open source", according to the Dutch law on elections. As we are working on this software at the Dutch Electoral Council, we want to share our experience and invite you to check out our progress so far. We'll go into our development process and technical choices, show some of the cool contributions we received, some of our own code and show what happens when a small government organisation decides to take software development into its own hands. At the talk both the lead developer and teamlead are present, to be able to elaborate on the actual development and on the management of such a project.</description>

                <abstract>As everybody knows, "L" in IoT stands for long-term support.
I'll take you on a tour of my technical adventure where I revived an abandoned IoT "AI" translator and gave it a new life, 2025-style. 
Through deciphering peculiar protocols and formats, reverse engineering firmware and software and doing the necessary research to write new software, we'll see how curiosity and persistence can help you overcome the most obscure technical challenges.</abstract>

                <abstract>What happens when an attacker controls time on a Linux system? This talk looks at how system clocks work, and what breaks when they’re manipulated. From bypassing delays to triggering subtle logic errors, we’ll explore how unstable time can subvert assumptions, break security controls, and cause software to behave in unexpected or unsafe ways.</abstract>

                <description>This talk explores the consequences of full control over time on a Linux system. We’ll start with a brief overview of how system clocks work, highlighting common assumptions made by applications and security mechanisms. The focus will be on local manipulation of the system clock — jumping forward, rewinding, or freezing time — and the unexpected ways software can break when time becomes unreliable.
Through practical examples, we’ll see how time-based defences and logic can be bypassed, exposing vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed. Not every issue leads to a full exploit, but many reveal fragile trust assumptions rarely tested in real environments.
This talk is for hackers, tinkerers, and developers who’ve ever relied on `sleep(1)` as a defence mechanism. You might rethink your assumptions about time-based security after attending.</description>

                <abstract>This talk hopes to provide listeners with insights into the historical background &amp; current state of scientific understanding of the biological &amp; psychological basics of how psychedelics affect human brains. An outlook of where the 'renaissance of psychedelic science' may take humankind will further be connected to the current state of psychiatric drug approvals &amp; clinical research. This talk will attempt to address every level, from those with no prior experience to seasoned psychonauts.</abstract>

                <description>Title got you looking? Good :) Welcome! In this session, I want to endeavor to introduce you to some of the things that really float my boat: Neuroscience (read: the Brain as understood through biology and psychology) and Psychedelics. Listen, as I aim to connect my studied, experiential knowledge to whatever mileage you may pack. Give me a chance to explain why I think Anarchy is a biological state; how drugs have come quite a way; where we are with returning to access to these tools for the 'Betterment of Well People'; and how I think we can take action for even better prognoses of the positive outcomes from this new research. Come out, come out, wherever you are..</description>

                <abstract>This is NOT an introductory talk about ISMS (Information-Security-Management)! It is about my experiences and reflections about real-life issues when deploying an ISMS. There will be a section dedicated to 'hacking' an ISMS, though.

The presumed audiences are:
- individuals working in the realm of IS-/IT-security management
- hackers working in environments that expose them to ISMS-related TODOs (I'll try to put these things into context!)
-  anyone trying to understand this ISMS-nonsense</abstract>

                <description>If we look beneath the surface, we find a lot of code that we trust in zero trust environments without realising it. Istio containers in service meshes, key management systems in SSH/Ansible environments and a whole lot of legacy code in confidential computing require trust in strange containers, ex-employees and attestation processes and a CI/CD pipeline for microcode in the cloud. What questions should we ask ZT?

As the management of keys is crucial for TLS (encryption on transport), disk encryption (encryption on rest) and the new kid on the block confidential computing (encryption of data in use) we look under the carpet of implementations and raise a lot of questions to ask if implementing the concept.

This immediately affects any digital souvereignty.</description>

In this workshop you'll learn about the Rust  programming language and write your first simple Rust program. Suitable to anyone with basic programming knowledge, you don't have to be an expert.

This session will be about half presentation, half practical. Come with a laptop prepared to write some code. Please get Rust installed before the session, which is very quick easy to do on any platform via: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</description>

                <abstract>INgrid = Energy Recycling company (Energie Maatschappij)

We got bunch (about) 20 old solar panels lying around.
Also battery's and all stuff needed to run a super small kitchen (if Sunny)
We also have a hometrainer that supplies energy.

The workshop will be about finding ways to still use all this Energy, which was all state of the art only 10 years ago, and is now already garbage/trash/worthless????</abstract>

                <description>By: Hamza Tafsi and Alexandros Tokatlis (DIVD)
Making the grid smart is part of the solution, but present its owns set of challenges, because by controlling and manipulating a lot of small consumers or producers at the same time, an attacker can still have a large effect on the grid.
DIVD currently has a research project (https://www.divd.nl/energie/) devoted to this and Hamza and Alexandros are researchers in this project.
In this talk they will show you how they attack smart energy systems using a Honeywell Smart Thermostat as an example device.
After the presentation the presenters will stick around the D42D area/cluster where there will be plenty of devices for you to try and hack and maybe even earn your own CVE.</description>

In this workshop, sponsored by DIVD, you will be building your own Mashtastic pager with decent components that, unlike some devices from certain dubious sources from certain countries, will not explode (we hope, but won't guarantee).
 
All parts will be available in limited supply in the tent at a pay what you want/can policy, if there are any proceeds they will go to DIVD.
Please bring your own laptop if you can to flash and configure the device.</description>

                <description>A collection of interactive installations connects art with (complex) science. Theories and model systems from the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics and more are at the base of intriguing images, sounds and texts that you yourself produce. Or is it the other way around?
Caution: The access to the labyrinth is at your own risk. Wear comfortable clothes. High heels are not recommended. Children have to be supervised at all times. Unfortunately the Labyrinth is not accessile to wheelchair users.</description>

Age range: All ages
== Workshop Description ==
Learn SMD soldering by making a duck.

Workshop given by [[User:Arne|Arne]].

Materials cost: €10

Batteries not included, you will need 3x AAA batteries. I have a small quantity of batteries available to test your duck. 
  
== Sign-Up ==
At the event, on paper. Please come to the Hardware Hacking Area to sign up and buy the Duck kit.

There will be more Duck kits than workshop spaces, so you can also buy a kit to solder on your own if you prefer. Printed instructions are included with the kit.

== Complete Hardware Hacking Area Village Schedule == 
Workshops are all free to attend.&lt;br&gt;
The prices in the yellow boxes are the materials costs for participating in the hands-on part of the workshop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge.png]]
Increase and test your soldering skills with this challenge in the shape of Stonehenge.&lt;br&gt;
* Prior soldering experience helps, but is not mandatory
* The components are mounted in an unorthodox way making this a unique challenge
* Kit includes
** Empty PCB
** A 3D-printed multipurpose base
*** Nice base to display the finished board
*** Store components during assembly
*** Protect the finished board for transport by placing it upside down
** All the components including some spares
* Because this is a last-minute-project, some things are not perfect
** There is no software yet to actually light up the LEDs (help wanted, will most likely change during the event)
** The Microcontroller has not been verified to work yet

  * Materials cost: €5 to €10

Workshop given by cpresser.&lt;br&gt;

A rope jam is an open, unstructured space for tying, practicing, or learning together. You can come alone, with a partner, or in a small group. Attendees are encouraged to: self tie, seek others to tie with, be tied by, switch with, observe or talk rope with.

These self organised rope jams will be ad-hoc throughout the weekend (you're also free to come tie any time).
The schedule will be on the whiteboard in our village.</description>

Bored of talks? Burnt out on pixels? Swing by and solder.
Participants can assemble and program their very own blinky PCB — a tiny circuit that flashes their name in Morse. Whether you're new to electronics or just need a break from abstract systems talk, this project hits the sweet spot: tactile, nerdy, and extremely satisfying. And yes, you get to take it home.
