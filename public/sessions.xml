Bij de levering van Mifi devices doet zich een vreemde situatie voor. Met behulp van hardware-hacking probeer ik te bevestigen of te ontkrachten of er werkelijk iets speelt.
Deze talk zal in het Nederlands gegeven worden en is primair voor DutchPicknick-ers. Anderen zijn ook welkom, maar de exacte tijd moet nog even bepaald worden. Zit je niet in DutchPicknick, meldt je vooraf even bij ons village.</description>

[https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/cheese2_why/ To secure spot on the Session 2. (Day 3, SUN 19h00) please sign in here.]


Each cheese tasting session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for this one (like three times overbooked). If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.

This event is based on '''donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds'''.

So lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!

To add your own cheese, add it to the wiki below

Age range: 9-12, 12-16, 16+, 18+, Aimed at adults but supervised kids welcome.
First you will receive a short general introduction of how a splice works, what is important and what else happens around it. Then you can try fiber optic splicing yourself. Please cancel the appointment if you don't have time so that others can take over. You should have a basic interest in the topic, a little patience and a steady hand.

Splicing is the process to connect fiber ends of a fiber optic cables. With single-mode glass fibers, the core diameter of the actual glass fiber is 9µm, which is smaller than a human hair.

More timeslots will be added.</description>

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

Have you ever been curious about the process behind this amazing drink called beer or do you just like beer in general? We will be brewing a SMaSH (single malt and single hop) beer on site on Day 1 and then enjoy the product on Day 4 on wards.

Beer is brewed using a brewing system and then later served through a cold tap. Make sure to bring some type of container suitable for beer consumption, as there will be a tap available during the brewing session!

Location is close to the Sauna/Salmiakki.

Update:

The session is currently on hold due to the current infra issues.
We have created a signal group to keep people updated :)

Update:

We will cold crash the beer at the foodhacking village over night!

The tasting will begin 17:00 local time at the Salmiakki village, bring your own glass!

I have a few boxed full of random hardware, mostly smaller things like arduino boards, usb adapters+cables and 3d printing equipment (nozzles, etc). I am giving it away for free. It is placed in 5 IKEA boxes and 1 cardboard box located in front of our village tent (Worldclass) - just take what you like (but please put everything back into the boxes that you don't want, just to keep it tidy).

Everything located in our tent and on the backside is NOT for "sale" - that's stuff we still want to keep and use.

Security teams want to prevent incidents - but what if controlled breaking prevents catastrophic failures? Drawing from aviation safety, chaos engineering, and resilience design, discover why 'unbreakable' security comes from breaking things on purpose. Learn to transform incident culture from blame to learning, implement controlled failure practices, and build psychological safety that turns near-misses into competitive advantages.</description>

The cardset "done with dominance" is a really helpful tool to discover and dismantle structures of dominance within groups and (group)relationships. It was made by some people from German climate activism contexts, and the cards set and website exist in German and English. We who host this session are not the ones who made the card set, but we think it is good if more people get to know and use the card set, especially also in the Chaos Communities, and that's why we do this session.

= Stop the Bleed - practical skills for daily life in Ukraine =

In Ukraine, instead of reanimation, most people learn how to stop the bleed, to deal with the aftermath of attacks. 

Even though it is not the first thing you might need, learning this skill gives you a good feel for the situation in cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. 

=== Registration ===

Registration is at the Village! We have about 10-15 places for each session

=== What will I learn? ===

Tatiana and her assistant Niels will show you to apply a tourniquet, how to apply hemostatic gauzes in bleeding wounds and how to apply pressure bandage. 

And you can try all of it yourself with training tourniquets, rubber fake wounds with red fluid and training pressure bandages!

=== How should I prepare? ===

Don't put on your most expensive dress. We have suits to keep your clothes kinda clean, but no warranty. For sure it will be messy, but it will be fun! 

=== Can I support this? ===

Yes for sure! If you want to support our foundation Aid to Ukraine, you can donate towards stop the bleed-kits which we will bring to Kharkiv.

It's like Who Wants to be a Hacker Millionaire, but the questions are all hard questions about programming, networking, and hacker culture. 

...and the lifelines are all silly:

- Call a DECT friend

- Ask a shitty local LLM

- Ask the audience (must answer in unison)

- Drink a shot to eliminate an option (infinite re-uses)</description>

We all speak high about privacy and safety of internet use. The EU also has extensive legislation to protect people, businesses, and copyright holders.  However, in my experience, projects have very successful ways to make it difficult to execute your rights.  To name a few tricks: it's hard to find the source data collection, there are many data collections, you are required to deliver a difficult proof you have legal rights, and all processes are different.

Here, I generalize various kinds of "execute my right" processes under the name "take-down requests".  It could be the wish to take down a physical server, all virtual servers of a certain company, a webpage with proclaimed defamation or other illegal content.

The very good reason to make submission of take-down requests hard, is that handling them is a labor intensive ad-hoc process. Some requests are clear, but sometimes many different laws and local society feelings have to be considered.  Very certainly, different data maintainers will decide different about the same request.

The Lethe project tries to simplify the submission of take-down requests to many data collectors at the same time.  It defines a clear template and collects various proofs about the claim by the submitter.  Then, it does not only distribute the request, but also shares the effort that participating data maintainers put in handling the claim.  For instance, NCSC-NL might report: "server shutdown", so the search engine index maintainer does not have to handle the request anymore, simply remove the pages from the index.

We will present the first steps towards this standardization, looking for contributors and funding.  Hopefully, this workshop starts a healthy debate.</description>

        <description>KiCad is the preferred choice when it comes to electronics design in fablabs and Fab Academy. 

Session 1 (9 Aug 13:00-14:30)
During first session we will cover what to do when you just installed KiCad without libraries (because you want it to be fast) and you somehow ended up in a desert with no internet connection, but with a datasheet...

Session 2 (10 Aug 13:00-14:30)
From there we will take advantage of a few Starlinks (or your own cubesats) passing by, just enough to be able to download the Fab Lib, which is a KiCad electronics component library based on the Fab Lab / Fab Academy electronics component inventory...

Venue: Be aware that the venue might change to the boat fablab on the Western outskirts of the camp. Just check some 30 minutes before the event here.</description>

[https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Recipe:Traditional_Kimchi_making_manual Workshop manual is shared here.]

This is hands on workshop where your learn how to prepare Korean [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi 김치 (kimchi)]. You will do at least two types of kimchies based on wild/spontaneous fermentation. We will see what type of nice vegetables we will get. Highly likely we will do cabbage kimchi (배추 김치) and then either radish, topinambur or turnip kimchi.

The preparation of vegetable ferments in Korea, called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi “kimchies”], is an ancient fermentation skill based on spontaneous fermentation (naturally occurring lactic acid producing bacteria among the others) and variety of ingredients added. This workshop is a hands-on experience that reviews the basics of Korean kimchi making and today's preparation styles. We will go through the main topics which are salt to vegetables and liquid ratio and when to apply it and how. This one is crucial. We will explain the importance of the effect of ginger, garlic and spicy pepper and their roles in preventing unwanted microbial development. Part of this workshop is tasting of kimchi samples so you get idea what should your results taste like. You will be leaving with jar of kimchi and knowledge how to make your own.

This workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.</description>

This event is dedicated to cider, cidre, sidra or how ever you would like to call beverage prepared by fermentation of apple juice. This event is run by František [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvasírna Jara] project which is a commercial one. 

'''Aims&amp;Selection'''
The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more "complex" "natural ciders" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poirés (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poiré which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.

'''Style'''
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid "commercialization" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace.

This tasting event is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.

We provide a large number of interesting whiskeys and appropriate snacks to show you the wide range of things the world calls whisky (or whiskey). Dutch, Japanese, Irish and Scottish We ask you for a 25€ donation for this event, which is a steal considering the number of whiskies you will have to taste. You are also invited to bring your own bottle to this event to make it even more insane.

        <description>Age range: Aimed at adults but supervised kids welcome.
Bored of talks? Burnt out on pixels? Swing by and solder.

Participants can assemble and program their very own blinky PCB — a tiny circuit that flashes their name in Morse Code. Whether you're new to electronics or just need a break from abstract systems talk, this project hits the sweet spot: tactile, nerdy, and unique. And yes, you get to take it home.

Depending on your experience, you will find yourself spending about ~30min with us for soldering and flashing pre-made code. In case you want to dig deeper into the programming part and create your own blink code and customize it, feel invited to stay a little longer.

+++IMPORTANT NOTICE+++

Due to logistical restrictions, the number of soldering irons is _very_ limited at our session. If you can and have a soldering iron available, please take it with you. You might also ask around your village or nearby neighbors to borrow one, many hackers carry small USB or DC powered irons with them. Thank you for your understanding! All other materials are available in sufficient amounts.

        <description>Join us for a practical, hands-on workshop focused on threat modeling in the healthcare space — specifically targeting open-source medical devices like the Android Artificial Pancreas System (AAPS) and OpenAPS. Whether you're a hacker, healthcare professional, or security researcher, this session will boost your ability to think critically about medical device risks from both engineering and cybersecurity perspectives.

We'll explore a blended approach using tools like Attack Trees, INCLUDESNODIRT and STRIDE uncover potential failure points, attack surfaces, and security weaknesses in real-world scenarios. Participants will work together to collaboratively model threats, identify risks, and (if time allows) see if mitigations exist today. The insights generated will be shared back with the OpenAPS community to help improve real-world patient safety.
No prior threat modeling experience is required — just bring your curiosity and a willingness to tinker with one of the most fascinating intersections of healthcare and cybersecurity. By the end, you’ll walk away with new skills, a structured threat modeling mindset, and a deeper appreciation of why cybersecurity in healthcare truly matters.</description>

(Hack your bag)..actually more a makers thing but still fun to do ;-)

== Heat Transfer Vinyl Cutting &amp; Arts &amp; Crafts ==
I'm bringing my small transfer press and vinyl cutter (a Brother Scan 'N Cut, not something self-built unfortunately...) and several little bags (made from an assortment of upcycled coloured fabrics) to decorate.

* '''Please note:''' All materials (Heat transfer vinyl, bags, fabric, etc.) come from my personal stash, a small donation to help cover material costs is very much appreciated - just leave whatever feels fair to you!
* '''Concerning kids:''' Kids are welcome! But '''only''' with parents or adult supervision. Any unattended 'free-range' children will be politely redirected back to their designated adult faster than you can say "where did I put that child?". ;-)


If you're interested, drop by '''Pancake village'''! You're welcome to create or bring a design and decorate your shirt, bag, or whatever you want. 

If you'd like to use my equipment, I do ask that you:
* Respect the WHY2025 code of conduct "Be excellent to each other!" and be mindful about your designs: [[Code_of_Conduct]]
* Decorate at your own risk - once pressed, you '''cannot remove''' the vinyl and might have to live with imperfections. But hey, you've made something custom and unique! ;-)
* Be very careful with the transfer press - it gets '''HOT!''' (130-160°C). Kids cannot use the press without supervision!
* Only press cotton, polyester/cotton blends or nylon items! Other fabrics generally don't play nice with the heat and could melt or won't work with the vinyl I'm bringing. When in doubt, ask me to check the fabric label first so we can adjust the temperature accordingly.

=== Practical info ===
* I'll be around most of the time, but if you don't see me, ask around Pancake village for '''Distels''' or poke me on IRC
* I'll bring small bags (for dice, card decks, or small knick-knacks) and fabric that you can decorate and, if you like, hand-sew into something. Or you can bring your own items to decorate. 
* As long the items are 100% cotton, a polyester/cotton blend, polyester or nylon, it'll work with the vinyl I'm bringing.
* You can bring your own design files in SVG, PNG or JPG format, GIMP works fine for this, and we can try to convert those to .fcm with varying success. 
* Simple designs in SVG or PNG with thick lines and black/white work best. Unfortunately .FCM is Brother proprietary and my plotter works only with these files
* Please please please... don't hack (or break) my setup. I will probably keep everything offline but USB sticks can do damage too ;-)
* Your design needs to be mirrored, especially if you're using text. Unless you like it backwards ;-)
* I will '''try''' to provide a laptop or pc on which to convert designs from .PNG/.SVG to .FCM or to make small adjustments before cutting

=== Other stuff I'm probably bringing ===
* Assorted yarn, crochet/knitting needles and other fiberart related stuff
* Random craft supplies (paper, glue, scissors, colored pencils, etc.)
* Hand-sewing supplies 

=== Tips if you want to decorate a shirt  ===
* I'm not bringing any blanco shirts since I cannot predict your size and don't have a stock, but you can get some at the local shops: Zeeman, Action and HEMA have, not too expensive, T-shirts and aren't too far from our campsite (check [[Facilities]]). 

Join me for some relaxing old-school arts and crafts. You are welcome!</description>

Beer Exchange at Our Village – Share What You Love!

At the Camp, people from all over the world come together — and many of us share a passion for great beer.
Local brews often reflect the character of a place, but some are so small-scale you’ll never find them online or in shops.

That’s why we’re hosting a beer exchange in our village!

Bring a few special beers from your hometown — the quirky, the rare, the traditional — and swap them with fellow enthusiasts.
Let’s share stories, flavors, and maybe even organize a casual tasting session together.

This is your chance to discover beers you'd never find outside your region — unless you're here, at this Camp.

First you will receive a short general introduction of how a splice works, what is important and what else happens around it. Then you can try fiber optic splicing yourself. Please cancel the appointment if you don't have time so that others can take over. You should have a basic interest in the topic, a little patience and a steady hand.

Splicing is the process to connect fiber ends of a fiber optic cables. With single-mode glass fibers, the core diameter of the actual glass fiber is 9µm, which is smaller than a human hair.

More timeslots will be added.</description>

Welcome to WICCA: a coven of tech-savvy witches hacking not with wands, but keyboards and crypto jokes! We're not just casting spells, we're probing vulnerabilities, decrypting mysteries, and raising TLS certificates (no cauldrons spilled)—all while sipping coffee or Club Mate.

Let’s meetup for some drinks and catch-up on Saturday @ Xyberfoort at 17:00 o'clock. For all members of WICCA and people who want to get acquainted with WICCA, we'll see you at the 9th of August at 17:00 o'clock. There will be stickers!

Thanks to Onyx Cybersecurity for hosting us again!</description>

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

= Stop the Bleed - practical skills for daily life in Ukraine =

In Ukraine, instead of reanimation, most people learn how to stop the bleed, to deal with the aftermath of attacks. 

Even though it is not the first thing you might need, learning this skill gives you a good feel for the situation in cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. 

=== Registration ===

Registration is at the Village! We have about 10-15 places for each session

=== What will I learn? ===

Tatiana and her assistant Niels will show you to apply a tourniquet, how to apply hemostatic gauzes in bleeding wounds and how to apply pressure bandage. 

And you can try all of it yourself with training tourniquets, rubber fake wounds with red fluid and training pressure bandages!

=== How should I prepare? ===

Don't put on your most expensive dress. We have suits to keep your clothes kinda clean, but no warranty. For sure it will be messy, but it will be fun! 

=== Can I support this? ===

Yes for sure! If you want to support our foundation Aid to Ukraine, you can donate towards stop the bleed-kits which we will bring to Kharkiv.

Thanks to the cool people from Movies that Matter https://moviesthatmatter.nl/ we can show Photophobia, life in Kharkiv through the eyes of two children:

'''PHOTOPHOBIA'''

Deeply touching fiction-documentary hybrid, looking at the war in Ukraine through the eyes of two children in search of a ray of light. Niki (12) and Vika (11) meet in the underground subway tunnels where their families hide from Russian bombs. ‘A positive attitude can help you forget everything.’

On a cold February morning, 12-year-old Niki and his family arrive at the Kharkiv metro station to take shelter from the terrifying war raging outside. For Niki’s family, daylight is synonymous with mortal danger, and the boy is not allowed to leave the station premises, living under the constant glow of their neon lights. While aimlessly wandering around the abandoned cars and full platforms, Niki meets Vika (11), and a new world opens up to him. As their bond strengthens, the children find the courage once again to feel the sun on their faces.

Slovakian filmmaker duo Ivan Ostrochovský and Pavol Pekarčík choose the path of hope rather than despondency to depict the tragedy of war: a nice man sings lyrics about love, while two children look towards the sky and their future.

Come and join us at the Back to the 80s party village for some Kraftwerk and Craftwork! This workshop consists of two parts. First we'll dive into the interesting lyrics of the German music group "Kraftwerk". Already in the 1980s, they were working on data ethics. What can we, 45 years later, learn from them? Let's discuss that together (even if you're not familiar with Kraftwerk yet)! Inspired by this band, we'll then continue with the second part: craftwork! We will provide the materials so you can create your own album cover art, for your own imaginary (techno-critical?) band! :)</description>

Do you enjoy breaking the rules? Violating guidelines and proprietary policies? Than this session is for you. 

Explore the limits of large language models by probing, jailbreaking, stress-testing, and bypassing their guardrails. 

You will learn how safety filters work, identifying vulnerabilities, and experiment with prompt engineering or adversarial inputs. 

The aim is fun, sharing skills and discovering ways to harden AI systems against misuse. 

The workshop is a mix of technical stuff, ethical discussion, and a touch of cat-and-mouse play.

Bring your laptop and subscriptions to your favorite LLMs or LMstudio installed for local action. 

This session is the hands-on counter part of the self-organized session on the AI Adoption and Accreditation Institute on Monday

When you live in Google, MicroSoft or Apple space, then you can easily move between applications: their programs offer a SSO (Single Sign-On) and share user data between their services as if they are one. Independent service providers have organize registration by themselves, and may use "Login via Google" (etc) simplifications. This uses Oauth2 and often OpenID Connect. The related shared information is really limited and of poor quality, however.

The EU NGI project OpenWebSearch.EU tries to create shared web search facilities under EU laws. This has many challenges: it's simply not known how to interpret the GDPR on freely crawled webpages. But my sub-project focused on creating a single sign-on to get access to the many other sub-projects. A kind of "Google Search Console" front-end. Also designed for a Google scale.

Open Console simplifies service connection authorization to a level never implemented before.</description>

Session 1 (9 Aug 13:00-14:30)
During first session we will cover what to do when you just installed KiCad without libraries (because you want it to be fast) and you somehow ended up in a desert with no internet connection, but with a datasheet...

Session 2 (10 Aug 13:00-14:30)
From there we will take advantage of a few Starlinks (or your own cubesats) passing by, just enough to be able to download the Fab Lib, which is a KiCad electronics component library based on the Fab Lab / Fab Academy electronics component inventory...

Venue: Be aware that the venue might change to the boat fablab on the Western outskirts of the camp. Just check some 30 minutes before the event here.</description>

[https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Recipe:Kefir_making_manual_-_short_workshop_form Workshop manual is shared here].

This is hands on workshop during which you will learn how to make, harvest and continue to prepare [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir kefir] using kefir grain culture which you will walk away with if you don't defend yourself too hard. We will explain basic concepts of probiotic, prebiotic and biofilm based polycultures and why it is good to consume foods “labeled” by these terms. You will prepare your own kefir culture, based on the  [https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Recipe:Kefir_making_manual_-_short_workshop_form working manual] and take it with you so you will be ready to brew wherever you decide hopefully “positively infecting” your local hackerspace. We will make at least one recipe together, either "kefir cake" or kefir smoked paprika spread, if we have time we may do a base for probiotic kefir drink using kefir whey.

We will demonstrate how to make a new batch of kefir and how to harvest the old one, you will than do it by yourself. The main aim of this workshop is for the participants to understand the principles behind the milk fermentation with kefir culture and not to be afraid to just do it. Combined with the practical experience which I provide you will be able to take care properly about your kefir culture which is the key for your successful long term fermentation adventures! Don't worry too much about loosing a batch or two, that happens from time to time, keeping the "mother culture" happy is the important part. As usually there will be tasters, cultures sharing, manuals and various hints how to use the products in alternative ways making for example probiotic drinks from whey, kefir cheese spreads, kefir cake et cetera. I can be also your troubleshooting help if you need it. 

This workshop is donation based no one turned away for lack of funds, if you can chip in around 10€, that would be great but it is up to you.</description>

Each cheese tasting session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for this one (like three times overbooked). If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.

This event is based on '''donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds'''.

Vla is the Dutch version of what Germans know as "pudding", or in English might be close to custard... There are sooo many tastes - from classical vanilla &amp; chocolate to blanke vla and one with additional, sweet flavours. 
We will buy a lot of them and let you taste them. If you want, bring your own bowl and spoon - but there's also cutlery in place.
If you want to bring your own favourite thing, you can do so, but it is not expected.

&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt;  Frans will explain what AI and ML is, and the use of this in health care and life sciences. Professionals have to understand the risks in applying AI when patients may be affected. These systems have to be validated, and guidelines and standards are available. &lt;br&gt;
During this presentation some interesting and important guidelines will be presented. &lt;br&gt;
Participants will get a basic understanding of AI and ML, what risks are related, and know about EU regulations and other guidelines that are available. The determinants for the Quality of Data will be discussed and how this can be measured.</description>

Starting with a blank node.js project, step-by-step we’ll gradually build up a fully compliant OGC’s API Feature service to share your spatial information (Are you familiar with GeoJSON? Cool, that is what we’ll be using – is not, also cool: we’ll explain it with simple examples!).
All code and example reside on GitHub.
Prior knowledge: node.js (javascript) is a plus, but not strictly necessary, a basic understand of programming is enough.

In this demonstration we are going to show how to find the signals of a NAND flash chip (i.e. CLE, ALE, RE, WE, CE etc). This can be used in for example a broken SD-card. An SD-Card has a controller and an internal connection to a NAND Flash chip. If the controller is broken it might be possible to access the NAND flash to get to the raw data. But in some cases the connections are unknown. This method demonstrates how to find these NAND flash signals by using an FPGA and do an exhaustive search by sending commands to the chip in all possible combinations until a response is received from the chip.</description>

Age range: 9-12, 12-16, 16+, 18+, Aimed at adults but supervised kids welcome.
First you will receive a short general introduction of how a splice works, what is important and what else happens around it. Then you can try fiber optic splicing yourself. Please cancel the appointment if you don't have time so that others can take over. You should have a basic interest in the topic, a little patience and a steady hand.

Splicing is the process to connect fiber ends of a fiber optic cables. With single-mode glass fibers, the core diameter of the actual glass fiber is 9µm, which is smaller than a human hair.

More timeslots will be added.</description>

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

Let's meet in 2 days, on Sunday, 2025-08-10, from 17:00 to 18:00, at the 
BornHack star tent in the Loud North cluster[1]. Both BornHack and 
ANDERSTORPSFESTIVALEN won't be blasting out music during this time, so 
we'll hopefully have a meeting where we can hear each other.

Remember, Morgan has a talk[2] tomorrow on their work on Gosling and 
Ricochet-Refresh at 19:00 in Brachium.

Hope you have a joyful festival!

Cheers,

This project began with a broken mechanical pinball machine from the 1981s. I completely stripped it down, repaired the structure, and replaced the mechanical scoring and control systems with modern electronics and custom software. The result is a fully digital pinball experience housed inside the original cabinet, combining classic design with modern gameplay.</description>

= Stop the Bleed - practical skills for daily life in Ukraine =

In Ukraine, instead of reanimation, most people learn how to stop the bleed, to deal with the aftermath of attacks. 

Even though it is not the first thing you might need, learning this skill gives you a good feel for the situation in cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. 

=== Registration ===

Registration is at the Village! We have about 10-15 places for each session

=== What will I learn? ===

Tatiana and her assistant Niels will show you to apply a tourniquet, how to apply hemostatic gauzes in bleeding wounds and how to apply pressure bandage. 

And you can try all of it yourself with training tourniquets, rubber fake wounds with red fluid and training pressure bandages!

=== How should I prepare? ===

Don't put on your most expensive dress. We have suits to keep your clothes kinda clean, but no warranty. For sure it will be messy, but it will be fun! 

=== Can I support this? ===

Yes for sure! If you want to support our foundation Aid to Ukraine, you can donate towards stop the bleed-kits which we will bring to Kharkiv.

Thanks to the cool people at Movies That Matter https://moviesthatmatter.nl/ we can show the story of Alisa Kovalenko, My Dear Théo, with messages she sent from the front to her family: 

'''My Dear Théo'''

''Alisa Kovalenko''

A moving and personal documentary by filmmaker Alisa Kovalenko, who made a profound choice in 2022: while her partner and their four-year-old son left for France, she joined the Ukrainian army. During four months at the front, she wrote letters to her son Theo and recorded her experiences in a cinematic diary. 

In My Dear Théo, Kovalenko, known for the documentaries Home Games and We Will Not Fade Away, which were screened at film festivals worldwide, swaps her role as a filmmaker for that of a soldier. In poetic, deeply moving letters to her son, she reflects on the harsh realities of war and her search for humanity amid violence and loss. The letters, which were later recorded, form a rare and powerful contrast to the raw images of the war zone: they capture both existential angst and the unbreakable bond between a mother and her child. 

With her intimate and confrontational images, Kovalenko blurs the line between personal and collective history. My Dear Théo is not only a record of struggle and survival, but also a timeless testament to love, hope and human resilience.

        <description>FreeCAD is getting better every year and there are more reasons to use it for your CAD needs than you could possibly imagine. Some people have the prejudice that it is complicated, cumbersome, buggy, but in fact, all CAD packages have a learning curve. The way FreeCAD is different is that it does not lock you in a subscription model, it does not require to log in or make any kind of account, it works and behaves the same on all OS platforms. 

In this session we will cover a rapid way of designing a thing based on several years of experience instructing the Fab Academy and solving CAD problems for other people. Join in and maybe some of that could be useful for you.</description>

[https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/cider_flows_why2025/ Session II. Day 4, 18h30, to secure spot on this guided tasting workshop please sign in here.]


This event is dedicated to cider, cidre, sidra or how ever you would like to call beverage prepared by fermentation of apple juice. This event is run by František [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvasírna Jara] project which is a commercial one. 

'''Aims&amp;Selection'''
The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more "complex" "natural ciders" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poirés (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poiré which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.

'''Style'''
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid "commercialization" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace.

This tasting event is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds". Part of the workshop benefits goes towards fhb budget and hopefully larger part towards [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor's]] pocket to cover participation costs at WHY 2025 event and if some extras are accumulated, then towards current and future fermentation projects.

== Workshop Description == 
The Pathlighter PCB, initially known as the Glow Club PCB, is a wearable piece of PCB art crafted for the community.
It serves a dual purpose: as a practical tool for teaching about LEDs and soldering, and as a creative demonstration of using a PCB’s foundational layers to craft a unique art piece. Designed to be worn on a lanyard, the Pathlighter PCB acts as a beacon, lighting up the night and ensuring safety for its wearers.  
  
This innovative PCB made its debut in an electronics education group and has since been featured in soldering workshops at ToorCamp 2022 and Chaos Communication Camp ’23. Its design is particularly well-suited for larger events where workshop demand often outstrips available resources. The Pathlighter PCB’s efficient design allows newcomers to complete their project in approximately 20 minutes. This swift completion rate creates a “revolving door” dynamic in the workshop, allowing for a continuous flow of participants and maximizing educational outreach.  
  
Having been taught to over 450 students so far, the Pathlighter PCB workshop has been a delightful experience to teach students how to solder and to earn a unique wearable art piece. Each participant not only learns valuable skills but also becomes an honorary member of the Glow Club. May we all shine brighter together through these shared experiences.

Age range: 9-12, 12-16, 16+, 18+, Aimed at adults but supervised kids welcome.
First you will receive a short general introduction of how a splice works, what is important and what else happens around it. Then you can try fiber optic splicing yourself. Please cancel the appointment if you don't have time so that others can take over. You should have a basic interest in the topic, a little patience and a steady hand.

Splicing is the process to connect fiber ends of a fiber optic cables. With single-mode glass fibers, the core diameter of the actual glass fiber is 9µm, which is smaller than a human hair.

More timeslots will be added.</description>

Let's go stargazing! 
On good nights I'll have two telescopes and a pair of binoculars set up, as well as some books about stargazing. 

The moon phase is full or near full. It's a nice sight. 
Other than that we can look at some nice clusters or Saturn which is rising relatively early in the night now. 

If you have your own telescope, bring it too! Let's check out each other's gear.</description>

Where the goths at? 

Freshly learned how to mix and I'm excited to share the music I love :3

Let the french tranarchist lesbian lead you to party and listen to cool stuff 💜 :3c

You can expect, among others and in no particular order:
* Post-Punk
* Darkwave
* New-Wave
* Coldwave
* Techno
* Hyperpop
* Girls screaming in a microphone
* Feminism
* Trans rights
* Lesbianism
* Some French lyrics

This event is open to every soul (especially my fellow LGBTQIA+ people) enjoying darker music! No dress code, obviously, but feel free to dress up to the nines! 

Again, and for legal reasons (allegedly):

= Stop the Bleed - practical skills for daily life in Ukraine =

In Ukraine, instead of reanimation, most people learn how to stop the bleed, to deal with the aftermath of attacks. 

Even though it is not the first thing you might need, learning this skill gives you a good feel for the situation in cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. 

=== Registration ===

Registration is at the Village! We have about 10-15 places for each session

=== What will I learn? ===

Tatiana and her assistant Niels will show you to apply a tourniquet, how to apply hemostatic gauzes in bleeding wounds and how to apply pressure bandage. 

And you can try all of it yourself with training tourniquets, rubber fake wounds with red fluid and training pressure bandages!

=== How should I prepare? ===

Don't put on your most expensive dress. We have suits to keep your clothes kinda clean, but no warranty. For sure it will be messy, but it will be fun! 

=== Can I support this? ===

Yes for sure! If you want to support our foundation Aid to Ukraine, you can donate towards stop the bleed-kits which we will bring to Kharkiv.

* Prior soldering experience helps, but is not mandatory
* The components are mounted in an unorthodox way making this a unique challenge
* Kit includes
** Empty PCB
** A 3D-printed multipurpose base
*** Nice base to display the finished board
*** Store components during assembly
*** Protect the finished board for transport by placing it upside down
** All the components including some spares
* Because this is a last-minute-project, some things are not perfect
** There is no software yet to actually light up the LEDs (help wanted, will most likely change during the event)
** The Microcontroller has not been verified to work yet

  * Materials cost: €10

  * Documentation https://gitlab.ccc.ac/cpresser/stonehenge

Have you ever been curious about the process behind this amazing drink called beer or do you just like beer in general? We will be brewing a SMaSH (single malt and single hop) beer on site on Day 1 and then enjoy the product on Day 4 on wards.

Beer is brewed using a brewing system and then later served through a cold tap. Make sure to bring some type of container suitable for beer consumption, as there will be a tap available during the brewing session!

Location is close to the Sauna/Salmiakki.

Update:

The session is currently on hold due to the current infra issues.
We have created a signal group to keep people updated :)

Update:

We will cold crash the beer at the foodhacking village over night!

This would be in addition to the [official schedule rope jam https://program.why2025.org/why2025/talk/NVCRLH/] on the Sunday.

A rope jam is an open, unstructured space for tying, practicing, or learning together. You can come alone, with a partner, or in a small group. Attendees are encouraged to: self tie, seek others to tie with, be tied by, switch with, observe or talk rope with.

These self organised rope jams will be ad-hoc throughout the weekend (you're also free to come tie any time).
The schedule will be on the whiteboard in our village.</description>

=Getting started=

1. [https://delta.chat/en/download Download the FOSS DeltaChat app].

2A. Create an account on the suggested chatmail server.

2B. Connect via IMAP to your own server by choosing 'use other server' and 'classic e-mail  login'. Be sure that option is on to move messages to a separate folder to avoid cluttering the mail ox. Upside: existing email discoverability, more decentralized. Downsides: messages take longer to arrive and risk of being throttled by your mail provider.

3. Join the [https://i.delta.chat/#89F6E44864D46FEE0B701CFB472D6638244B129F&amp;a=j7j7nqo7y%40nine.testrun.org&amp;g=WHY&amp;x=OsE3DK5TH18CI6WLEc9q58Qx&amp;i=jkT2D4K6RKCIfI5K24QzxMej&amp;s=GgRtOvD-Ray9qsPgYDrBWvpW WHY room] and try out chat, or [https://webxdc.org/ decentralized chat web apps].</description>

Welcome to Reality Cult 3°33'33 — where mysticism meets metadata.

Behind a veil of tarot cards, planetary symbols, and poetic AI, lies a karmic debugging tool for the disoriented soul. This interactive experience offers short readings for festival wanderers who suspect their existential bugs may come from earlier code — soul-code, that is.

🜂 What to expect?

Quick karmic scans to identify the emotional malware running your relationships and life loops

Past life file access, revealing patterns, names, and forgotten scripts

Open tarot protocol — ask the cards anything. Yes, anything.

A ritualized fusion of astrology, intuition, and sacred satire

Optional deep-dive sessions: for those who want to remember what they were doing in 1742, or why they always fall for the same archetype

Since 2022, Reality Cult has been steadily accessing the Akashic Records (cosmic hard drive) and uncovering over 250 past life identities. By combining tarot, AI, and symbolic language, this project explores how identity, memory, and karma persist across incarnations.

👁 Each session is part performance, part soul hacking. Whether you’re just curious or karmically desperate, Reality Cult offers a chance to glimpse your deeper storyline — and maybe even change it.

Come with a question. Leave with a breadcrumb trail across lifetimes.
